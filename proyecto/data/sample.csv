It was the first FPS game I ever played, and I first experienced it in 2005 on my oldest Steam account, which, unfortunately, I no longer use.   My memories from the days of playing Counter-Strike 1.6 are filled with joy and excitement. I recall the long nights spent gaming with friends, where we fought together in the game and forged friendships that extended far beyond the computer screen  We learned to cooperate, communicate, and trust each other to win matches. These experiences shaped my social skills and taught me the importance of teamwork.  Some of my closest friends today are the ones I met on various Counter-Strike servers. We didn't just share virtual battles but also life's joys and challenges. These friendships are precious, and I'm grateful for the memories we've created together.  Even though time has passed, and we may have lost touch, the memories of those good old Counter-Strike days will always be a part of me. It's amazing how a game could connect us and create lasting friendships that will endure a lifetime. ❤️",1698221018,1698221018,1,2,0,0.545454561710358,0,1,0,0,1,""

Feito em 1999, o CS é um jogo táctico de tiros onde duas equipas (Contra-Terroristas e Terroristas) lutam uma contra a outra, onde para vencer é preciso ou matar todos os inimigos, plantar a bomba ou desarmá-la. Para a época, fora uma grande novidade, visto que tratasse de um mod do Half-Life.   Ainda hoje, em pleno 2023, é um jogo que continua a ser muito jogado - principalmente pelos jogadores da ""velha guarda"" - e não deixa de ser uma grande fonte de entretenimento para todos! Jogo-o desde os meus 12-13 anos e nunca parei de jogar. Desde novo, a jogar nos servidores portugueses com pessoas a rondar os seus 30-40-50 anos de idade após sair da escola. Antigo membro orgulhoso da antiga equipa [TugasMadrugas] (Sr. Bigodes era o meu nome) e de que hoje tenho muitas saudades.   Hoje em dia, os servidores portugueses são praticamente inexistentes, ora porque passaram definitivamente para o CS:GO (agora CS 2), ora porque deixaram definitivamente de jogar. Envelhecer tem destas coisas. Contudo, ainda existem muitos servidores por esse mundo fora e muito activos, estando todos eles praticamente sempre cheios.   Counter-Strike será sempre um jogo que ficará para sempre na minha memória e é um jogo que ainda hoje o jogo e que, muito provavelmente, continuarei a jogar por muitos anos.

That's right, a Counter-Strike game with no bots. What is this?!?!  Without any bots to play against, you can really only play against players, and that's nearly impossible at this point due to how old this game is and the little community that it has. This game doesn't get many players, meaning it's almost impossible to actually play it unless you stay in a multiplayer server by yourself for hours and hours until someone actually joins.  If the developers add bots, I'll replay the game and edit my review accordingly. I do recommend this game, but my experience has just not been positive, due to the fact that there's nobody to play this game with, making this game basically turn into a ""walk around and shoot stuff and do nothing else"" simulator.

If you are someone who has never played counter-strike 1.6, I would have a tough time recommending this unless you want to check out where counter-strike got its roots from. There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouch walking (some may call it silent-stepping, groundstrafing, g-stafing), quick-switching to reload faster, boosting people through roofs, the insane amount of wall bangs you can do. Some do raise the skill cap. Where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, bhopping was around before counter-strike but counter-strike had bhop communities as well. This is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models. This and counter-strike: condition zero are the only counter-strike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counter-strike which made knifing non-competitive. You could get a headshot with a knife; how could you not like that! The graphics are definitely dated by today’s standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it. Counter-strike does not have a built-in matchmaking ladder like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much esports history made in counter-strike. The reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement a cheating protection know as Valve Anti-Cheat with counter-strike being the main focus. This game reminds you just how good you had it when you were a kid and not many games can rival the impact counter-strike has had on the esports and gaming industry.",1696335174,1696341474,1,0,0,0.0,0,1,0,0,1,""

It's a dance of strategy, chaos, and the occasional hilarious ""no-scopes"" that turn the battlefield into a comedy of errors. Grab your armor and get ready to cha-cha with terrorists and counter-terrorists alike!  [h3]Pros:[/h3]  1. [b]Time-Tested Gameplay:[/b] The gameplay is a relic of the past that aged like fine wine. It's like playing a classic board game where the rules are etched in stone, and everyone knows the dance steps.  2. [b]Tactical Depth:[/b] Counter-Strike  is the thinking person's shooter. It's like chess, but instead of knights and bishops, you have terrorists planting bombs and counter-terrorists defusing them.  3. [b]Community and Mods:[/b] The game boasts a vibrant community that's been keeping it alive for decades. Mods and custom maps are like remixes, breathing new life into the familiar tunes of Dust and Aztec.  4. [b]Low System Requirements:[/b] Counter-Strike  can run on a toaster. It's like the friend who's always invited to the party because they're low-maintenance and know how to have a good time.  5. [b]Nostalgia Factor:[/b] For many players, Counter-Strike  is a trip down memory lane. It's like finding your old mixtape and realizing it's still as cool as you remember.  [h3]Cons:[/h3]  1. [b]Outdated Graphics:[/b] The graphics have aged more than a time-traveling DeLorean. For players accustomed to modern visuals, it might feel like staring at a painting from a different era.  2. [b]Hackers' Haven:[/b] The game's age also makes it a haven for hackers who have honed their craft in the virtual underworld. It's like attending a dance party where some folks have mastered the art of teleportation.  3. [b]Steep Learning Curve for Newcomers:[/b] New players might feel like they've stepped into a tactical minefield. The learning curve is steeper than climbing Everest, especially when facing off against seasoned veterans.  4. [b]Limited Variety of Maps:[/b] While the classics are timeless, the map variety can feel a bit constrained. It's like having a favorite dance move, but sometimes you want to try something new.  5. [b]Occasional Toxicity:[/b] The community, while vibrant, has its fair share of toxic players. It's like being the new kid at school; you might encounter a few bullies on the virtual playground.  [h3]Conclusion:[/h3]  Counter-Strike  is the granddaddy of tactical shooters, offering a nostalgic dance with terrorists and counter-terrorists. While it might not boast the flashy moves of its modern counterparts, it's still a classic groove that gets the heart pumping.

However, I think I would like a bit more feedback during combat. Enemies kind of just come running towards you and your melee combos are often fast enough to end them without the need of a counter attack or dodge.

Lors du développement d'un jeu, cela arrive que le studio change son idée de départ pour toucher une communauté plus large. Ici, il s'agit du multijoueur et des événements réguliers tout au long de l'année.  Si j'ai voulu réessayer encore et encore, c'est parce que les débuts du jeu m'ont vraiment plu. Sauf que vue la tournure, je préfère rester sur la dizaine d'heures de fun d'il y a 2 / 3 ans.  Je laisse mon avis précédent :  J'ai vraiment accroché à ce jeu, c'est mignon, la jouabilité est plutôt bonne et c'est vraiment un jeu sur lequel j'avais de bons espoirs. L'héroïne qui sors des répliques de films d'action, l'humour, la difficulté parfois très corsée.  Vue qu'à l'époque (plus d'un an), j'avais atteint la fin du scénario implémenté et que les événements ne me plaisais pas du tout. Que les bugs et temps de chargement étaient chiant, j'ai désinstallé le jeu en attendant qu'il soit terminé.  Aujourd'hui je l'ai réinstallé et testé à nouveau. C'est toujours en accès anticipé, mais j'étais curieux de l'avancée du jeu et j'avais vraiment envie d'y rejouer.  Un message sur l'écran de chargement prévient que l'écran peut paraître figer. OK, c'est bien de prévenir. Sauf qu'il y a un autre écran de chargement derrière. J'arrive enfin au menu et sélectionne nouvelle partie.  D'ailleurs, je soupçonne l'introduction d'avoir été changée, en plus elle c'est lancée avec le son de l'écran de chargement. Bref, plus 15 minutes et j'attendais encore de pouvoir jouer.  Ce problème de lancement / chargement était déjà existant il y a plus d'un an ! Il fallait lancé le jeu deux fois pour espérer jouer. Et là c'est pire !  Alors la situation sanitaire a pénalisée pas mal de studios, ça je peut le comprendre et toléré. Mais le chargement, la sauvegarde, c'est quand même des basiques. On boss pas sur des événements saisonniers quand la base du jeu n'est pas correcte.  Voilà pourquoi je le déconseille mais en l'état d'accès anticipé.

[b]Surprise, this is a third-person shooter, mostly inspired by the fragfests of old like Blood or Doom, and boy, what a charming love letter it is.[/b]  The game's first thirty minutes give you a concise overview of Carol's abilities, from melee combat to platforming, including of course shooting anything that feels somewhat hostile. The game will take it slow at first, introducing the player to the gameplay, and giving him a bit more plastic weaponry as he progresses. This won't last long, however, as the game will quickly pick up the pace, and present [b]an ever-increasing and satisfying arsenal[/b], from water uzis to rifles that shoot foam rounds, a very real flamethrower disguised as a toy, and many, many more. Shotguns are particularly top-tier, none of them feel underpowered. Even the hair dryer would later become an even better sidearm, with powerups found in secret places. Carol will also benefit from other upgrades, most notably a double jump and an air dash, who will definitely accelerate the game's combat. It even has stealth mechanics as an option, which was something completely unexpected. [b]The game would then introduce bonus levels scattered around. They are a nice change of pace[/b] from the main run n' gun adventure, and are pretty varied, from platform levels which may or may not be inspired from Crash Bandicoot, to a kart racing mini-game and a tank battle arena. Some of them give a welcome surge in difficulty, as several deaths are expected. Speaking of a kart race, [b]there are indeed vehicles. Practicing a bit with them is important, but it quickly becomes second nature to control them[/b], some have mounted guns and the game sometimes raises the enemy count, just to give the opportunity to mow them down. Said enemies not only vary in style, but while a good chunk of them only fight in melee, others might have other abilities like using weapons you can pick up, raising ice walls, cast a wave of fire, and more. [b]It becomes easy, even instinctive, to assess a foe's threat just by looking at it. A simple, yet succesfully mastered display of enemy design[/b], seen in other popular games like Serious Sam. [b]All of this taken into account, the game ends up being massive for an indie game[/b]. The adventure mode, by itself, is already 18-22 hours on the hardest difficulty available, without looking (too much) for secrets, and isn't even finished yet. On top of it, there is also several arena modes, all playable up to 4 players, in co-op and versus. For around 18 bucks, you get more content that other games with a bigger budget only wish for.  Onirism doesn't simply take inspirations from other games to build its gameplay, however. [b]The game's universe is filled with videogame references. Some in-your-face, others more hidden.[/b] Among them, we can find Serious Sam (a lot of Onirism's foes do feel and act like Serious Sam's bestiary), but also GoldenEye, Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Blood, Doom, the list goes on. On top of these, the game has a charming universe, filled with brief but funny encounters and jokes that don't go under the belt. [b]Carol, the heroine, steals the show during the cinematics[/b]. With her brattish attitude and her tendency to resolve many of her troubles with ultra-violence, she only needs to steal quotes from Duke or Caleb to become a kid friendly version of your average 90's FPS hero. The other characters are funny, and have personality, but while some will get screentime throughout the adventure, some sadly are here only for a 30-second cinematic, only to be never seen again. [b]Spider mommy and Tex need more love.[/b]  What is definitely the best part of this universe is clearly the soundtrack. Ranging from beautiful ambient pieces, to blood pumping battle themes, the overall quality of the OST goes from ""pretty good"" to ""Gonna wake up the neighbors with that BANGER"", with the latter sentence fitting a great majority of the game's music. Personal favorite is that one metal music heard in the more intense arena fights in the ice levels. [b]The store page would look prettier with a ""buy the soundtrack"" button.[/b]  But among all this praise, there are some elements that give the overall experience a (very)slightly sour aftertaste. For instance, the team is doing his job to optimize the game the best they can, but it's still a bit rough around the edges. Some of the loading times have recently been cut in half, most notably the one to start the game, but you might still have time to rev up the coffee machine before the loading is complete once you get to the later areas currently available. Also, the keybinding, for some reason, the game won't let you bind the middle mouse button to an action, and there is no hotkeys to switch immediately to a preffered weapon, only scrolling through. The options menu, having an awkward scrollbar to check through the keybinds, and being only in english no matter the chosen language (english and french are currently available) doesn't help.  [b]Those imperfections being for the most part very minor, they won't ruin the fun the overall game can provide[/b], those problems can eventually be fixed, and the team shows pure passion for this project, dropping content and bugfixes regularly. [b]They added, for instance, a difficulty selection, a welcome feature to a game that otherwise lacked challenge during 80% of the adventure.[/b]If this is your first game, playing on Normal will be understandable, but should you have some experience with action-adventure games, you can start on Hard or Very hard without any problem, you will get tossed around more often by the bosses and bonus levels, who apparently aren't bound by the rule of ""be nice to the player, he's probably a kid"", but without doing so, most of the available gear like grenades and elixirs won't find any use during most of the game.  [b]In short, Onirism is most likely one of the most charming and fun third-person shooters you can find in early access. Fast-paced combat, likable characters, lots of content (and more to come), a completely unhinged heroine, and an absolute banger of a soundtrack, this is a love letter to video games that everyone can enjoy.[/b]",1610487801,1670628058,1,14,0,0.665719449520111,0,1,0,1,0,""

The video games board from my favorite chinese basket weaving forum made me buy this, so i expected nothing and damn was I wrong. TLDR at the end.  [u]Firstly, the game is in early-access, is it playable right now ?[/u]  YES. I had very few technical problems playing this, but having a really good config is highly recommended, i could only play with graphics on low since my config wasn't good enough for higher settings. This game uses A LOT of RAM so you better have 16GB of it if you want to play this with the best settings. You can still play with 8GB like i did, but only on the lowest settings.  Even with low graphics, the game didn't look bad, it is still completely playable.  Also, you should install it on a SSD, it really lowered the loading times (which are quite long), in comparison with a HDD installation.  The loading screens might appear stuck or freezed, but it's normal, just wait until loading is over : don't click or try anything  in the meantime as the game could stop responding. Sometimes the game wouldn't launch, i never had to launch it more than twice to make it work though.  There are few in game problems, i noticed that sometimes you had to jump over some slopes/steps when it appears you could just walk on them, or sometimes you can get stuck in an infinite fall if you jump on the corner of some objects/parts of the environment, but nothing too bad as i always could go back on my feet somehow. I never fell under the map or worse, even though i tried to parkour in many places. Maybe the game needs a bit of polishing in this matter, but nothing is currently really problematic. Another flaw of the game is the inventory system which is currently kinda bugged and works in a weird way, but i never lost anything though.  [u]Ok but, does it have any content though ?[/u]  YES, took me something like 20 hours to reach and finish the last level currently available on the main adventure. I took my time to do all the bonus levels on the way, and visit the maps to find the hidden guns/skins etc... though. According to the roadmap it's like a third / half of the planned full game.   Then, there are the seasonal events (it looks like they are all available at all times, and not only during summer, halloween or christmas etc...), i didn't play them all yet, but the few i played are really good too. Some event maps are played a la Call of Duty Zombie mode : you have waves of enemies coming at you, perks, guns to buy, doors to open to unlock all the parts of the map etc... And it's not poorly done, some maps are huge with a lot of things to do. These will be great in multiplayer (which is not released yet).  [u]Nice, but what are you supposed to do in this game ? [/u]  The game is a TPS and your character is Carol a 10 year old girl chasing a shady person who stole her bunny plush Bunbun. The story is quite simple, but the characters are good, especially Carol who is trashtalking the enemies all the time. I don't know how are the voices in english, but they're great in french with many references to pop/video games culture (there's even a line taken from Helene et Les Garçons a french sitcom from the 90's, i really didn't expect that !) You can feel that the game is a tribute to old classic games, for example : during the stealth part of game, enemies sometimes barrel roll like the enemies in Goldeneye 64, that's a stupid detail, but it's great ! There are many references to other games/movies etc...  There are a lot of enemies on your way and you have a HUGE arsenal of different weapons to defeat them. There are many different enemies, with boss fights, arena fights, some parts of the game are in vehicles (boat, tank etc...) and bonus levels have other gameplays : side scrolling platformer, obstacle courses...  The game is very diverse and there's already a lot to do.  [u]Well this looks like a game for children, can my niece/son/clown fish play it ?[/u]  This game is okay for all ages, there's nothing shocking in it, no swear words or scary parts, BUT in terms of difficulty this is clearly NOT a walk in the park, so your niece/son/clown fish better be quite the Faze clan 360° noscope pro to get through some parts of the game. I'm thinking for instance about the arena fight near the observatory of Pinewood city : there's like 6 million enemies coming at you, your health and ammo are limited, you have very little space considering some enemies will build walls on your way, the fight is very long etc... And as I already stated, we're far from the final levels who should be even more difficult.  Even as a good player, you won't get bored and you should brace yourself for some parts. Nothing impossible though.  The controls aren't frustrating or difficult to understand, i just wish dash and sprint were on different keys, just to increase the reactivity of the sprint, other than that the character is fast and has an overall good maniability. Some parts of the maps are impossible to reach yet because the double jump isn't available (or maybe i'm just dumb and missed something), but it happens in like 2 occasions.  [u]In the end, how does the game feel overall ? [/u]  Overall, the game is great and looks highly promising for an early-access, the gameplay is great, there is always things to do, places to explore, guns and outfits to collect. The sound design in nice and the music is really awesome, it's far from being a generic and boring background filler.   Onirism is really refreshing, despite having ""classic"" game mechanics, they're done in a really good way. It deserves way more fame than other early-access indie games that are rushed/unplayable/indefinitly on stand-by etc... I don't understand how so few people know it considering how good it is. I hope it gets the recognition it deserves, and I'm glad to see more and more people talk about it online.  [u]TLDR[/u]  Buy it, it's a very good game, really worth it, even though there are a few bugs, nothing ruins the experience. Have a good PC though. Some stated that the game is too hard and had too many enemies, or that you could get lost in the maps (they are quite big), but if you're not a complete incompetent it'll be okay. To those, the only thing i can say is : GIT GUD.",1610220961,1610220961,1,6,1,0.553390800952911,5,1,0,1,0,""

En effet, Onirism se développe dans un univers où vous trouverez des territoires qui invitent à l'exploration avec un personnage principal attachant et un doublage réussi (pour ce qui a été doublé à ce jour).

Lors du chargement du jeu on lit une notification sur la fenêtre Windows qui peut être bloquée (on parle de la fenêtre il me semble, donc prenez soin d'écrire ""bloquée"" au féminin et non ""bloqué""). Je ne cite que la première faute, je ne citerai pas toutes les autres mais les gens ont payé pour le jeu. Un minimum de professionnalisme ne fait pas de mal.  - La dernière pour finir, parce que je trouve ça dommage de continuer pour un jeu qui semblait si bien.  Les joueurs comme moi aimeraient beaucoup pouvoir profiter des graphismes qui sont très agréables, profiter sans se faire harceler chaque secondes par les monstres. Sérieusement, je n'ai rien contre la baston j'adore ça et le jeu n'est basé que sur ce principe (parce que niveau scénario il n'y a que des quêtes sans intérêts qui sont des prétextes à la bagarre, on en oublie qu'on est là pour retrouver une peluche !) Je trouve que niveau dosage de monstres c'est à revoir, ils reviennent très vite après que vous les avez détruits ce qui est frustrant les fois où on aimerait être un minimum ""posé"" et apprécier les décors... Exemple de problème semblable : il m'était arrivé d'ignorer tous les monstres croisés dans la forêt pour aller m'acheter vite une arme au village, j'ai fait mon achat tranquille et qui je croise qui m'attendait juste à l'entrée de la porte ? Tous les monstres que j'ai fuit m'ont gentiment attendu, ce qui fait grand monde dehors. La situation serait drôle si je ne passais pas déjà mon temps à leur taper dessus au point de m'en lasser.  Il y a a plein d'autres points que je n'aborde pas (la gestion de la difficulté, les véhicules aussi souples que des camions bennes, l'absence (ou la flemme?) d'explication dans tout le jeu, les sauts du jeu etc)  Conclusion : un jeu à accès anticipé qui est sorti trop tôt même pour un accès anticipé. On a envie d'y jouer mais les développeurs ne nous donnent aucun moyens pour l'apprécier à sa juste valeur. Je dis cela car j'ai l'impression que les avis sur les problèmes du jeu ne sont pas du tout pris en compte. Depuis que le jeu est en développement beaucoup de problèmes ont été soulevés par les joueurs et très peu ont été réglés, c'est dommage car vous avez de bonnes idées.  Je peux avoir un côté acerbe dans mes propos, mais très étrangement j'apprécie beaucoup votre jeu. Si je me trompe sur votre bonne foi, (ce que j'espère, encore une fois) vous avez tout mon soutien, ne lâchez rien. Je vous prie seulement de prendre sérieusement en compte les retours des joueurs. Vous êtes sur une bonne voie mais ça serait vraiment dommage de rester sur cette ligne. Sur ce, bon courage pour la suite !",1595764519,1595764519,0,21,0,0.678061068058014,0,1,0,1,0,""

Onirism is a fun adventure about a little girl through a strange dream dimension, and so far it's turned out to be a rough gem of sorts. There's a lot of good sides and a lot of downsides too, I'll cover those in quick lines.  [b][i]The good[/i][/b] --------------------- +[b]Charming Main character & character designs:[/b] Carol is adorable in both her English and French voices, tending to be a bit of a brat who only does the right thing if it helps her own goals. There's a variety of outfits to use as well!   There's also numerous enemy designs with their own charm, like the plush people and the plantfolks. [spoiler]Also spider designs that dont bother my Arachnophobia, big plus.[/spoiler] +[b]Really tight gun controls:[/b] Onirism has some fantastic shooting controls, a smooth way to swap in and out of them and a whole host of weapons to use and find. And with a small pool of total ammo types, you dont have to micromanage. Also chests found in levels that let you swap and store various guns out on the fly. +[b]Inspired Level design:[/b] Every level you come across tends to be full of color and life in one way or another, giving way to the dream aspect of it all. And several bonus levels come with designs straight out of people who might think fondly of [i]Crash bandicoot[/i], bonus levels like that light-puzzle in the first level, or Honey Sewers in the hive.  [b][i]The Bad[/i][/b] -------------------- -[b]Core Features Missing:[/b] While it's nice to have large, expanded levels its also really bad to do so without a map. Several times both of us playing would struggle to find our direction cause a map was so winding with no markers or map to examine. A top down map that marks out level transitions or goals at the very least would help! -[b]Numerous Bugs (Mainly Co-op):[/b] While this game has local co-op, it definitely needs some polish. There's a handful of bugs that seem to exist primarily in coop mode due to how the game handles it all. This includes: 1) Soft-Lock at Terminal/Hologram chats if both players interact at roughly the same time 2) P2/P1 is spawned as an immovable ghost if a cutscene is triggered by the other player while they're dead 3) P2 can't see their cursor or selection highlight in shop menus if P1 moves the cursor (P1 can also choose stuff for P2 as a result)  There's also some minor nuisances regarding how ladders and spawn positions are handled (Slipping off the sides, accidentally spawning outside the boss room for Hive Totem), but those are easily circumvented in comparison. -[b]Frustrating (other) level design:[/b] While some bonus levels are really fun and feel classic, others can be downright frustrating for reasons unfair or feeling unintended. One in particular that comes to mind is [b][i]windy gate[/i][/b], where platforms you have to hop across rotate. Thing is, they rotate in no particular pattern on timers almost wildly separate from each other resulting in situations that can corner you to fall and respawn.  Im having fun for what its worth, and with a little bit of polish and hopefully an injection for general popularity It can really shine! (Though there's nothing wrong with being a Niche, good game either.)  P.S: There's no steam guides, so what on earth are dreamstones used for?

Guns and umbrella feel like they don't do any damage. Hit boxes are all over the place, enemies attack through walls, and attacks hit you even when your not even close to it. Platforming is hit or miss sometimes you stop sometimes you get near the edge and keep sliding over. This is especially a problem when you have boxes to smash near the edge and everything including yourself go over. Not everytime you hit jump you jump especially if you are even close to the edge. The backwards running mini game in the volcano level is bad, needs to back the camera off the character another space or two. It really needs a map. I don't hate the game and I really do want to see it succeed, but it still needs a lot of work and just can't recommend it right now. I will stick with its development and update in the future.

On en veut toujours plus et ça fait extrêmement plaisir.  -Si on met bien évidemment les bug de côté, le jeu est excellent avec une aventure folle (bon après il y a des bug que j'ai vraiment chercher à provoquer et qui n'était pas prévu par les développeurs) mais c'est ça de chercher les petits truc dans les Early access et qui fait que c'est d'une partie marrante et de l'autre, embêtant quand c'est ""imprévu"" (surtout que ça fait penser qu'on est comme un bêta-testeur) et c'est pas désagréable, surtout pour contribuer grandement à ce projet qui selon moi, mérite d'être aboutit, car on sens que derrière, il y a la motivation et l'envie de nous faire découvrir des choses mystique et nouvelle (heureusement qu'on se fait surprendre, sinon bah, bah ça serait moins bien, logique non ?).   -Niveau Bug : J'ai rencontré quelques soucis, notamment en farmant les perles sur un des premiers niveau secret des chutes chromatiques où à un moment donné, 2 craporcs spawn d'un coup pour nous attaqué, et parfois, un seul coup de l'ennemi, suffit pour te faire dégagé à plus de 5 mètres sur le côté, ce qui arrive souvent à te faire tomber de la map (on découvre pas mal de chose à force de faire plus de 100 fois le même niveau pour des perles et avoir des tenues incroyable et hors de prix (en vrai, le prix ça va, ça reste honnête). Je signale ceci comme étant un bug car par moment, ça me fait le coup du boost et parfois pas quand je me fait taper par les craporc, après, je doute que ça sois lié au niveau, mais des ennemis en général. (ça arrive pas souvent donc ça va encore).  Par moment, il m'arrive de vouloir atteindre certaine plateforme en étant au pixel près de celle où je me trouve pour sauté (pas nécessaire mais j'aime bien être sûr de pouvoir atteindre l'autre plateforme sans être trop court) et par moment, souvent quand je cours, en voulant sauté, eh bien le perso ne saute pas et tombe car trop près du bord (non non, c'est pas un manque de skill ou de mauvaise fois, par moment, sans même le vouloir, j'ai bien remarqué que le perso ne voulais pas sauté et c'est comme si elle glissait vers le vide car trop près du bord) c'est assez particulier mais faut vraiment le ressentir pour le remarqué (à vérifier si c'est pas moi qui suis juste mauvais au final).  Au niveau du boss de l'Oasis, j'ai mis quelque try avant de comprendre comment le vaincre car quand on tire dessus avec certaine armes, eh bien on a l'impression que ça ne fait rien, pas de hit marqueur ou de signalement rouge, SAUF parfois, ça le fait qu'avec le sèche cheveux et une autre arme que j'ai oublié mais du fait que j'ai pas eu cette automatisme de me dire ""tien, ça clignote pas rouge, donc c'est useless"" eh bien, ça ma porté à la confusion car par moment ça le faisait mais c'était tellement court que j'me suis juste dit ""tien un bug"" ou bien le couldown de l'animation de hit est juste trop court. J'suis pas très clair mais, tout ceux et celle qui sont arrivé à ce boss, rassurez moi que vous aviez aussi le même soucis que moi (faite que je sois pas juste mauvais à vouloir être logique sur ce que j'ai vécu).  Dans l'ensemble, ça va encore, le jeu est fort heureusement jouable et appréciable (vivement le doublage de la suite du jeu et d'une option pour pouvoir revoir les cinématiques qu'on a découvert dans le jeu via les menus).  Dans les événements, j'ai pu tout tester, et il y a plusieurs map où l'on peut faire en sorte d'être insensible à tout les ennemi (sauf ceux armé) en étant posé tranquillement sur une hauteur où les ennemis se contente juste d'attendre en dessous de nous, donc pour les map survies, c'est broken, t'a juste à attendre pour rien et puis t'a gagné (sans aucun honneur). Sur une des map où il y a la piscine, un ennemi à réussi à me faire un damage boost et à me faire passé à travers un mur, ce qui m'a bloqué durant un petit temps, jusqu'à ce que j'arrive à me dégager dans la zone du dessous sans avoir payer 100 ou 200 perles pour y avoir accès en temps normal.  -Dernière chose (pas spécialement un bug) mais il y a 2 plateformes très précisément : 1 dans la première map des natifs au peuple florias où l'on peut apercevoir une plateforme au milieu de rien (là est tout le problème) où l'on peut y apercevoir un bonus qui augmente de 5 la taille maximum de nos balles de nerf. Sauf que bah, c'est inaccessible, par aucun moyen (où alors j'ai pas trouvé mais j'ai vraiment chercher partout, même là où j'étais pas sensé être. Merci les jeux sans mur invisible, je vous aime car ça nous donne une grande sensation de liberté et de possibilité). ps: j'ai malheureusement pas fait gaffe à ce que pouvait faire l'amélioration du sèche cheveux après avoir vaincu le boss de l'Oasis. J'ai cru comprendre que ça pouvait désormais traverser plusieurs ennemi quand je tire (j'espère que c'est ça, sinon, bah tant pis, je sais pas).  Et pour la 2ème map : c'est dans les marécages où il y a aussi une plateforme complètement inaccessible avec le bonus qui nous permet de pouvoir tiré plus de coup avec le sèche cheveux avant qu'il sois vide. J'ai chercher un peu partout aussi et pas par au dessus, ni même les mur, pas d'arbre suffisamment proche pour pouvoir y accéder, et encore moins tenter le damage boost sur le poisson qui rode dans l'eau qui one shot quand on se fait touché (dommage, l'idée était bonne...du moins au départ).  -Dans l'ensemble, voilà, c'est tout ce que j'ai pu relevé si je n'ai rien oublié. Très bon jeu avec énormément de surprise encore à venir et j'ai hâte, et vous aussi j'imagine. Franchement, un jeu prometteur, j'ai mis 21 heures de jeu donc : 19~ heures pour arrivé jusque la fin de l'early acces de la 1.6.2 en prenant le temps de vérifier tout les bonus et secret dissimulé un peu partout dans le jeu. 1h~ pour farmer un secret en boucle afin de pouvoir récolter un maximum de perles en un temps avantageux pour obtenir toute les tenues proposé dans le jeu. Et une 1 pour voir ce que donnait le mode survies, évènement et versus (j'ai pas d'amis donc j'ai du brancher une manette pour moi même afin de tester le versus). Rien cas voir le nombre de perso jouable, et ceux à venir, on a plus que hâte de les découvrir.  Voilà, ça sera tout, merci à tout les courageux et courageuse d'avoir lu mon pavé (j'me vois pas comme une personne faisant des critiques, mais j'avais envie pour une fois de faire quelque chose de complètement objectif et de juste dans ce que je disais afin de vous donné une idée de mon ressenti et aussi pour ceux et celle voulant découvrir le jeu.

Все диалоги динамичные и желания скипать их просто нет.  Записки, шарды, разговоры на улице, прочие прочие мелкие детальки - несут в себе кусочек информации о мире,  Персонажи делают ставки, наджебывают, не договаривают. Разговаривают в своих уникальных стилях, языках, диалектах эта часть, лично меня, цепляет и погружает в любой диалог или просто прогулку по улице.  боёвка казуальная но с своими прелестями. Даже захотел за Нетранера побегать. Стрельба не знаю, мили отличная, лично мне не хватило врагов которых нельзя закликать)) но минусы в том что все очень сильное и гранаты и катана. Если бы гранат было меньше или у них было кд. Врагов откровенно мало, хотелось бы не просто разные кланы + роботы + киберпсихи + смешер. А типо в клане любят импланты "" мелстромы "" и все юзают какие нить читерные импланты и против Мелстромов ты не можешь например пратяться за стенами, потому что тебя видно и в тебя уже летят гранты, пули прошивают стены а твою жопу хакают.  Ладно это уже придирки.  САМОЕ ГЛАВНОЕ это атмосфера, город проработан МОЁ ПОЧТЕНИЕ,  каждая улица, каждая засранная квартира или пентхаус Арасаки, все радует глаз и даёт информацию о том кто там живет и как он живет.  Эвенты в игре как вишенки на торте, завершают картину жизни и ты прям веришь что находишься там.  Телепорты наверно лишьние в игре, так как кататься это просто кайф)   Теперь к минусам  Это СИДИПРОДЖЕКТЫ. А значит шмот, оружие и вот это все чем игрок растет будет через ЖОПУ. Я кста игру прошел а перк на 20 лвл скила так и не смог взять. все было на 10-12 левеле.  Оружия много и оно вроде как разное. но все дикая имба потому что перки+ фиговый баланс шмоток.  И Легендарные вещи, всегда это бесило ЛЕГЕНДАРЫНЙ МЕЧ который поменяй на обычный и не кто не увидит разницу.  Ну возьми зделай рандомные статы на шмотках. что б игрок хотя бы пару раз за игру ощутил прирост силы.  Ветка талантов это просто ветка, без идей, без нечего. Просто урон качаешь.  Да есть синергии, Да они вполне себе уникальные ветки. Просто хотелось бы условий в перках по больше, что б не просто "" ой 500% урона с мили""   Ладно Целая стена текста. Но это обзор же.  Я редко прохожу игру до конца. Обычно смотрю механики и удаляю. Так как опыт становиться понятен и удивления в будущем не предвидеться. Тут все по другому) кусок контента с гранатами я ваще не дождался.  ОН ГДЕ ТО ТАМ ВПЕРЕДИ левелов так через 20 скила.  Сюжет меня втянул  с головой. Я действительно пожил в этом замечательном городе.

The biggest one is Sherlock Holmes' ""Logic Spectacular"" where the Great Detective does one of his famous cold reads on a suspect or situation and is....almost right (so you can back him up and correct the mistakes). These segments feel like they run just a little bit longer than they should, and I wish you could jump in sooner.  Thematically, there's a more cultural cosmopolitan / ethnocentrism undertone at play due to where and when this story is occurring: at the beginning of the 19th century when Japan is re-opening its borders and is getting pushed around by Great Britain. In past games, the different mixes of east and western cultural felt more like fun set pieces that fed into the set-ups for individual cases. In GAA, it feeds into multiple character motivations for why they feel and act.   This makes almost every case in both games feel like its part of a single story instead of a sort of anthology where the only reason there feels like a story is because of how the leading characters react differently over time (see Ace Attorney 1, where case 3 where nothing about the details of the trial linger further into the plot, it just serves as the trigger for Edgeworth's character growth).  Last little adjustment I like: all of the investigation segments are done in sequence instead of alternating between Investigation and Trial. It feels more natural.  The multiple witness interruption system feels like it could use some more depth, although I'm not sure how. It feels a little empty and gimmicky: if you see a witness interruption, it's always the right choice to follow it.",1628362795,1628362795,1,3,0,0.544066309928894,0,1,0,0,0,""

It's very easy to see how muddy the textures look and how models clip through each other on higher resolutions. Anti-aliasing needs some serious improvements and the game needs more options for the players to finetune the game for their computers, there are only 4 customisable options in the game: Resolution, Windowed/Borderless, AntiAliasing On/Off and V-Sync On/Off.  That's right, the graphics are not customisable, you're not able to tune the frame-rate... Just very barebones settings in general. The frame-rate is locked to 30 by the way, this includes all the main menu animations and this frame cap is there seemingly for no reason whatsoever. And before you say that it's normal to be locked at 30fps, I have to disagree since even the Nintendo Switch version runs  at 60fps.   Luckily there is an amazing mod to fix the frame-rate alongside some other issues:  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2563613403  And the audio... God, how did Capcom mess this up so bad? Luckily there is also an amazing mod to fix the soundtrack: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2560751137   I do use both of these mods myself, but I have to say that these issues shouldn't have been there to begin with. If you don't want to deal with all this garbage, I would honestly recommend buying the Nintendo Switch version instead if you already own the console. And please Capcom, for the love of god... Fix the PC version ASAP, I honestly expected better from a 39,99€ game.  -Localisation: The Good- Episode 1 The Great Departure is the way Ace Attorney games should be localised. Just the fact that you allowed us to play this game with the Japanese dub instead of the English dub was already a huge step in the right direction. Honestly, that is the way I would love to enjoy the mainline entries in this franchise, give us the option to play the games with the original dub, original character names and Japanese elements. I know I may just be beating a dead horse here by mentioning Ace Attorney Investigations 2, but honestly, I would love to play both Investigations 1 and 2 with a similar localisation seen in Episode 1 The Great Departure. Hell, I would love to play every game in the franchise with that kind of a localisation. Perhaps something worth attempting in a future entry?  -Localisation: The Bad- Now... I have to express that I am disappointed about some characters having their names changed. Now just to be clear, I am not referring to Herlock Sholmes here. I am referring to characters that didn't really have any copyright issue behind their change of name such as: 'Mitrov Stroganov' being renamed to 'Bif Strogenov' , 'Benjamin Dobinbough' being renamed to 'Albert Harebrayne' and most disappointing of all... 'Haori Murasame' being renamed to 'Rei Membami' Some of the changes were completely understandable, but honestly there were a lot of names that should not have been altered to begin with, unfortunately the localisation team went too far with the changes... Again.  -Herlock Sholmes- I know that some people have an issue with the fact that Sherlock Holmes was renamed to Herlock Sholmes and Watson into Wilson. However, this happens to be the only way we're able to enjoy these games in the west. It's not Capcom's fault that Sherlock Holmes has such awful copyright issues. If you want to complain to someone about this, complain to Conan Doyle Estate, since Capcom really didn't have a choice here.  -DGS1- An absolute master piece, I loved every moment of it. I honestly don't really have bad things to mention about this one. Perhaps my only complaint would be the lack of a task list during the investigation sections of the game. The characters were fun and unique, all culprits had solid motivations that even made you somewhat sympathetic of their fate.  -DGS2- I have to say that, DGS2 had a lot to live up to as a sequel to DGS1 and it is clear to see that it was aiming to be even more ambitious than it's predecessor. However, there were a few downsides to the scale of the game. For example, the lack of animated cutscenes was somewhat disappointing as they really contributed to the overall feel of the first game. However, the pros really outweigh the cons in this sequel. It had a significantly better story overall, having more twists and being darker than its prequel. It introduced plenty of new characters and expanded the soundtrack.   -Conclusion- Whether you're new to the franchise or a long time fan of the Ace Attorney games, this is something you absolutely have to play and enjoy for yourself as this is one of a kind masterpiece.",1628353142,1631221498,1,2,0,0.499051213264465,0,1,0,0,0,""

As far as technical details go, the game will run on even a potato of a computer. If you are interested in mystery-themed visual novels with over 50+ hours of content, I highly recommend this game.  [hr][/hr]  [h1]Detailed review[/h1]  [b]Note[/b]: this review is not complete yet. I have only finished 1 of the 2 parts included in this game.  Like the previous games in the franchise, this game is a visual novel with puzzle elements, where each “case” is spent piecing together the details of some mysterious crime (e.g. murder, theft, etc.). I'm usually not motivated to write reviews, but the amount of enjoyment I had with this game compelled me to write this review.  [h2]Pros[/h2] [list] [*] [b]Game structure[/b]. This game actually consist of two games, subtitled Chronicles and Resolve. However, these two games should actually be thought of as a single, longer game. The game is organized into 10 “cases” that tell a single long, cohesive story (where Chronicles and Resolve have 5 cases each). In contrast, most of the previous games in the franchise felt like a collection of unrelated short stories. [*]  [b]Writing[/b]. The characters are likeable and well-written, especially some of the side characters. The game is packed with humor, but still delivers serious emotional moments successfully. I enjoyed how the plot-twists unfolded, and the writing kept me constantly excited to know what would happen next. [*] [b]Animation[/b]. The characters are expressive and animated well. Some animations are highly exaggerated and are absolutely hilarious. [*] [b]Setting[/b]. The setting is very interesting and not something you would typically expect to see in a game like this: late 19th century/early 20th century at the height of the British Empire and during the rise of the Empire of Japan. [*]  [b]Localization[/b]. I don’t know any Japanese, but I can tell that the translators did a great job with the localization. The dialogue uses different vocabulary, dialects, and sentence structures for the different characters, which serves to highlight distinct personality traits and quirks. Additionally, the dialogue is full of puns and jokes (which I assume are also present in the original Japanese dialogue). [*] [b]Performance[/b]. The game runs well even with a weak graphics card. In fact, it ran well with a Radeon HD 6770, which is 10 years old. I’m not sure about how good of a CPU is required, though. [*]  [b]Controls[/b]. Can be played with both mouse/keyboard or controller. There are on-screen prompts in case you forgot what the keybindings are. [*]  [b]Save slots[/b]. Unlike most of the previous Ace Attorney games, you can save at any time, and there are up to 20 save slots. For context, I’ve only played the first AA trilogy, AAI, and AAI2. [/list]  [h2]Neutral[/h2] [list] [*] There is some character dialog that contains sexism, racism, and/or xenophobia. Although some players may find issue with this offensive dialog, it is consistent with the setting in the game (which I mentioned above). [*] [b]Difficulty[/b]. The game is too easy in my opinion. While this is great for newer players or players who only care about the plot (in fact, there is an option in the settings that puts the game on “story mode” and avoids the gameplay altogether), this is disappointing to experienced players (like me). [*] [b]New mechanics[/b]. The game introduces new mechanics such as “Great Deductions” and “Summation Examinations.” Although these are interesting variations of the typical Ace Attorney mechanics, the ones in this game feel too easy and/or too tedious to get through. [*] [b]Case writing[/b]. The cases in this game are not as involved as those of the previous games. Relatively speaking, the game has fewer events occurring in each case, and it instead has more dialogue and more details. Although this seems positive, the problem is that the additional time and details are not well spent (see below). [/list]  [h2]Cons[/h2] [list] [*] [b]Dialogue fluff.[/b] While most of the dialogue is great, there is a lot of fluff. For example, phrases such as “where is the evidence” are repeated too often, even in the later cases where this should has already been drilled into both the player and the protagonist. These repetitive phrases could have been omitted without changing the game experience. [*] Relating to the points I made above, some cases drag on about facts that are obvious to the player and are not even worth pointing out, and the protagonist is unable to see these facts immediately. Furthermore, even within those same cases, the protagonist is able to piece together far more obscure facts. These inconsistent behaviors feel more like flaws in the writing rather than intentionally designed parts of the game. [*] There are contrived plot points in some of the cases that left me disappointed and unsatisfied with the way these cases progressed. Combined with the other points I mentioned above, I feel like these cases definitely could have been written in a better way. [*] [b]No volume slider[/b] in the settings. Furthermore, although some other reviews mention the soundtrack, I was unable to hear most of it, even when I increased my system volume to a point where my ears would start hurting in other games. [/list]  [h2]Conclusion[/h2]  Despite these flaws, I immensely enjoyed the characters, plot, and problem-solving aspects of this game. Overall, I highly recommend this game.",1628322729,1628325791,1,1,0,0.529569864273071,0,1,0,0,0,""

Esto es, debido a que, al igual que muchos acérrimos fans de Ace Attorney que seguimos la franquicia paso a paso y al pie de la letra, ya jugamos la primera parte en una fan-traducción al inglés en su versión de 3DS, efectuada por el equipo de Scarlet Study hace un par de años si no me falla la memoria.  Para los que hayan seguido este recorrido exacto, estamos en la suerte de que en esta The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles se nos permite empezar directamente en el título que elijamos sin necesidad de jugar al primero de nuevo. Una consideración muy agradecida. -Como nota para cualquiera que haya hecho lo mismo que yo, y haya empezado con la fan-traducción de la primera entrega en la portátil de Nintendo, comentar que no he notado gran diferencia entre ambas versiones más allá de que la traducción oficial se toma la libertad de aflorar los diálogos por no estar sujeta a limitaciones técnicas y programáticas inherentes al romhacking. Mi única área no tan positiva, es que he notado que la personalidad de Iris Watson está un poco más aniñada de la cuenta con respecto a la contraparte más fiel al guión original realizada por el equipo de Scarlet Study, que me pareció muy adecuada y fresca. Más allá de eso, no hay ningún tipo de problema ni cambio chocante a la hora de saltar directamente de una a otra-  Es pues que escribo mi opinión después de haber visto el paquete completo de ambas aventuras.  ¿Recomiendo? Por supuesto.  ¿Hace falta haber jugado a otros Ace Attorney para entender este? ¿Es un buen punto de entrada? Siempre y cuando se juegue con la mentalidad de que estos juegos se hicieron con más de 12 años de iterar sobre la misma franquicia, y que al saltar de vuelta a la trilogía de Phoenix Wright, se van a perder por el camino una serie de elementos 'quality of life' que hacen la experiencia menos tediosa, no veo por qué no.  Si bien las primeras entregas de la saga son más simples en el apartado jugable... la narrativa, los personajes, y el humor que caracterizan a la franquicia, sigue estando ahí, por lo cual no hay nada que temer. Cada título tiene sus virtudes. Yo siempre recomiendo jugar en orden de salida... Pero mejor empezar por aquí, que no llegar a empezar. No es ningún delito.  ¿Es el mejor juego de toda la franquicia? No, pero podría haberlo sido, y me da pena de que se haya quedado cerca de la línea de meta. Creo que esta división en 2 títulos que se hizo en su momento hace flaco favor a la historia en la versión que tenemos entre manos. Si bien lo que se incluye en esta colección, es mucha densidad para un juego, no me parece que sea suficiente para justificar dos juegos. El primer título tiene un buen ritmo en lo que respecta a la manera en la que mantiene el interés, introduce elementos y desarrolla los acontecimientos, pero el segundo no tanto, en mi opinión.  Aunque al terminar no quede gota alguna en el tintero, creo que habría preferido una única entrega que durase aproximadamente 2/3 de lo que duran ambas aventuras combinadas y contase únicamente lo esencial sin perderse en cuestiones que podrían haberse resumido, y aventuras que a la hora de la verdad, son inconsecuentes para el desarrollo de la trama. Creo que ahí habríamos dado en el clavo con posiblemente la mejor entrega de todos los tiempos. No descarto otra posible re-interpretación en forma de trilogía, creo que estructurada de otra manera también podría haber funcionado bastante bien.  En definitiva, una compra segura. Para un seguidor bastante sibarita no está sin sus puntos más flacos que otros, pero no deja misterio planteado sin resolver, goza de un memorable elenco de personajes, buena banda sonora, ambientación, y un diálogo con giros y turbulencias que a cualquier fan de la franquicia o de cualquier tipo de narrativa de misterio y detectives gustará.  Muy buena colección.  (EDIT: Faltas de ortografía y párrafos)",1628258749,1628263057,1,0,0,0.0,0,1,0,0,0,""

Gameplay-wise, it's fairly fun and does enough to feel fresher compared to the Halos of yesteryear while not straying too much from the originals. The old artstyle returning, for example, was a good choice for keeping the ol' Halo feel that people complained about with H4 and H5. The weapons are cool, and there's enough of em to go around so you're not always stuck with AR and pistol.   While potentially on the more controversial side, I [i] do [/i] believe the new movement mechanics are better for the game in the long run. It makes it feel more modern, and while some people love the classic floaty movement, it just wouldn't feel very good in what's supposed to be a next-gen title. It's unfortunate, but the next step forward. I would like to hear some others' thoughts on this though, so do let me know your reasoning for if you prefer floaty movement.  My only real complaint is the new customization. I suppose it makes sense for a F2P game, but come on. A battle pass? Shaders I could tolerate, but there isn't even a way to get credits in-game without real-world money yet. You have to be clinically insane to think I'd spend ten bucks on a reshade. I don't even play battle royales, but at least those give you a cosmetic that looks good. The battle pass is a huge shame too. Like, I genuinely hope buying the campaign gives you the battle pass for good, because I will not spend 10 bucks every fucking time another one comes out. Doesn't help that they don't give you much in way of armor.  Yeah, that's about it.

(Right Now) it's a free to play multiplayer with a battle pass system, 3 Big Team Battle maps, and 5 Quick Play Maps. In order to keep you playing, they have purposely made the challenges RNG based, and have made the matchmaking RNG based as well, as you can't choose the game modes you want to play, so you're likely to queue for multiple matches before even having the opportunity to complete a challenge. That is also RNG based however, as it's like waiting for the 'Hero Powerup' in Battlefront (2015).  Shouldn't this be negative? Overwhelmingly so? It's very draining, as it's your only form of progression, but the core game is great. The audio, the feedback, the gun play is all fun. The customization clearly has potential, and since the game seems to be performing well, it's likely that adjustments will be made to the progression and customization (as they've already made temporary adjustments) in order to accommodate what the fans want. This is a 'beta', so things are going to be added and changed, but what should be known is that the fixes are simple and they'll be done in time.   The game is fun, it is likely to continue being fun, the developers are making the right changes, and it's a multiplayer game where skill and creativity is rewarded in a sandbox environment. This feels like the progression of a franchise that has been respected thoroughly, and it really is. Besides some of the obvious annoyances, it'll be fixed and it's great to play with friends and feel like you're returning to classic multiplayer days.",1637286012,1637286012,1,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,""

NOBODY PLAYS OBJECTIVE. Which might not be so bad but there is nothing gain by playing odd ball like slayer. Even in ranked.  Looks AAA visually, does not play like AAA. The classic guns aren't too bad besides the BR and Sniper. But every new gun is just bad. They are neat but its like 343 were too afraid to go all in so they just ended up half baked and practically unusable.  Multiplayers gameplay being bad is just the tip though. There is no progression system and only the battle pass. Leveling up the pass might be the worst part because as of now you only get 50xp for a match, no more no less unless you do a very specific weekly challenge which you have to go to a different gamemode to get. Most items(at least those worth getting) are locked behind a $10 pay wall. The credits to unlock it cannot be gained buy playing the game and has to be bought. You can just buy the whole battle pass for only over $200 for just season 1 or about 2000 games played roughly.  The multiplayer is just bad right now. Every gun beside the AR and rockets are awful or just don't feel right, doesn't feel good to use. After every match you have to go through 3 menus just to start another match, there is no auto play. There is NO PREGAME LOBBY and no post game lobby, where is the social aspect at? U.I. and menus are just a mess to use. When you're in game you can't mute people or block them using the scoreboard. Time to Kill in Infinite is the highest in the series or the guns are the weakest. Certain gamemodes should not have certain maps like Launch Site and One Flag or Behemoth and any gamemode. Behemoth is just terrible.  Visuals and Art Design : 10/10 : Best looking Halo in a decade  Gameplay : 3/10 : Gun-play and map layout are far from the best  Game Sound : 8/10 : It sounds really good beside the needler and warthog. Gun fire is also weird from a third person.  Soundtrack : IDK : It only ever uses one sound track that sounds like Cod and it got real annoying so its muted.  : Maybe Fixes : · Put in a Reach like progression system and customization like 2021 MCC (If anything please do this one) · Simplify the menus, it should be like two menus in from the main screen.

I won't ever give up hope for this game as its fundamentally an amazingly built multiplayer game disregarding the countless bugs and unbalanced sandbox, but there is always a possibility things could take a turn for the worst so I wont keep my hopes to the max. One of its biggest problems for me currently is the lack of maps for btb and btb balance in general, its all over the place especially on highpower where waterfall side casually gets 6 precision weapon spawns and the other only gets 2 but with the poor compensation of more shock/stalker spawns. Not to mention the big ass wall covering the middle of that map, but because of how one-sided highpower is, waterfall side has more to see in comparison to the other side, not to mention the middle pelican drop, that creates a lot of unbalance in the map too.

I wouldn't say this game competes with Little Nightmares in any way, but it's pretty hard to play this game and not acknowledge their similarity (and so I will).  Bramble: the Mountain King (BTMK) has upwards of 18 chapters, although it feels more like 14. Each chapter is brief, but they're completely unique and almost each features a ""boss fight"" of some kind. The game can be beaten in around 5 - 6 hours, and I beat it in 9 hours after getting 100% achievements and writing an achievement guide (check it out!) simultaneously. For this reason, I would say the game is overpriced and more of a $20 game, but I'm not complaining.   The art direction is good. The character design and the environment design are great, but the mythology is what makes this game stand out. Each character in BTMK is based off of Nordic fables, and the acts they carry out are dark and demented. Despite encountering the characters only briefly, they are what makes each chapter so memorable. Their tie-in to the main story is fitting, and it's impressive how many meaningful characters you experience in such a short time. Compared to the Little Nightmares games, there isn't really any guessing that has to be done for you to understand what's going on. This is nice, but when you finish the game, there isn't really more for you to do. There's no reason to go look up a lore breakdown or start a discussion why characters behave the way they do because, well, there isn't really any mystery. One thing I really loved about Little Nightmares were the metaphors the designers placed throughout each level, and how they helped foreshadow the story. To put it bluntly, BTMK just lacks that level of depth.  From an achievement hunting perspective, this game is very, very accessible although not particularly fun. The majority of achievements are for collecting figurines, so I wouldn't say the achievement hunting experience adds anything to the story of the game. Some are creative, but if you're looking for another ""perfect"" game to add to your steam profile — this is an easier pick. However, once achievement is to beat the game without dying (which I hate). I personally don't see a replay-ability in this game, so this achievement is a huge chore.   All in all, fun game, worth a buy, but consider wishlisting it until there's a sale.",1693280176,1693508811,1,0,0,0.0,0,1,0,0,1,""

Honestly, there is not a single moment/scene/puzzle I haven't seen in other games. The mini character in a overwhelmed large world? Try Unravel, a great puzzle-platform developed by Coldwood Interactive and published by EA. Get help from a giant? Try Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons released in 2013 by Starbreeze Studios, the latter has a similar story but far better execution and more interesting interactions.  What kept me playing till the end is the pure curiosity to see the fate of the boy. It doesn't change the fact that the scenery, the fight and the puzzles are all too basic and I get bored fast, there are few to look at and most look crude, which brings no excitement and even the disturbing monsters give a dry feeling, especially when their attacks are too simple, repeated and predictable. I finished the game in 3.5 hours, if not for the extremely slow walking speed and odds jump direction mechanic, otherwise it should be less than 3 hours.   Honestly I can't think of any highlights. Most puzzles are: Open a drawer to find a key to leave the house (if you call it a puzzle), chase creatures into sheepfold, find hidden gnomes, figure out a path in total darkness with zombies. Fight: Use sling shout on boss, but first shoot fixed targets and avoid repeated attacks, and then repeat. The only thing amused me might be the Hedgehog riding for 30 seconds. For the scenery, A big tree with hanged villagers and people being pinned by cross might be unique, but actually they are hardly not be seen in many games: Divinity: Original Sin, CoD, A Plague Tail... The light puzzle which you have to stay behind objects to avoid the light attack - try Candleman, or, Contrast by Compulsion Games. I am not complaining this game copies ideas, rather, it copies ideas and not doing well, just a collection of easy mini games without a core.  With the coarse graphics and buggy movement, nothing is impressive at all.  In my option this game failed to be a puzzle game, walking sim or action game. I may consider to rate positive if it sells for 9.99 but the listed price is 29.99, far overpriced for the limited contents and little entertainment it offers.

I like that this is an indie game and I hate having to downvote a game someone clearly put a lot of time and effort into making.

The story is relatively unconnected and the level design is far more akin to a walking simulator than anything else. The checkpoints were pretty unforgiving in the sense that you are forced to redo the most boring, unengaging ""puzzles"" over and over again because you jumped the wrong direction or your ankle got clipped by whatever bad thing is being shot at you.   I play challenging games. But there is no reason for a game like this to be so challenging. The final boss was so redundant and frustrating I couldn't stand it. It was just time consumption for the sake of ensuring this 4 hour experience wasn't a two hour experience. There were several parts of the game that were unnaturally elongated so that it wasn't too short.   Most of the horror is shock horror with no real depth to it besides, ""I murdered a baby, here's it's corpse"" or ""check out all this gore"". It lacked any real depth. I get they were going for the Grimm fairy tale, disturbing, vapid story-telling, but it just can't keep my interest for the whole 4 hours.

The game uses the very known and common WASD scheme for KBM that makes everything very intuitive. The controller is equally simple but users may face incompatibility issues that require driver updates.  [h1]User interface:[/h1] The game disregards having a UI; you rarely pick up items or have to interact with your inventory. It tries to minimize the immersion breaking feeling that a bad UI can bring, so it chose to have none. Sometimes a prompt can be seen on screen, sort of a QTE, but not really; in this case, they are quite visible and on your face, as they should be.  [h1]Graphics & art style:[/h1] The graphics and art style are mesmerizing and unique. The contrast between adorable and grotesque results in a very artistic duality that may cause a reaction in the player.  [h1]Voices, music, and sound design:[/h1] Flawless sound design with sound effects impeccably chosen and implemented. The right sound at the right time often resonated as a living part of the game environment; sounds were perfectly selected, designed, and curated to give living things more life. Superb music choices that give an opportunity for exploration into the world of great Swedish classics like ‘Dem Blomstertid Nu Kommer’ that will remark the contrast in the game’s dichotomy even more. The sound design, in my opinion, is simply perfect.  [h1]Environment & level design:[/h1] The game’s nature has the player explore many different environments within the game’s duality. Cute and vivid in colors and life, you wish to delve in, juxtaposed to macabre and gorey scenes you wish to end asap. Navigating the game’s environment in full immersion is truly an experience. The way the atmosphere is set up is such a great statement for good game design.  [h1]Characters:[/h1] The characters we meet in our journey are mainly derived from John Bauer’s works and Sweden’s mithology. As for the game’s polarized nature, the models design swing like a pendulum between adorable and grotesque, from smiling gnomes with lovely laughter to evil trolls with cruel facial features ready to chomp on you. All 3D models are evidently carefully crafted with great attention to detail that does not break the idiosyncrasies of the overall artistic style of the game. This style is very pleasing to the eyes. It might be the mix of realistic proportions with the at times cartoonish stylization, perhaps, but there is something unique to this style that I can’t really put into words; it is simply lovely and mesmerizing.  [h1]Story & storytelling:[/h1] This is where this game truly shines. The game has the player follow a story through stories. A great narration will have us navigate several mithologic or folkloric tales of the northern lands while we struggle to achieve our goal of finishing our own journey. The stories are told through classic narration, environmental exposure, and in-game events. The narrator, Nola Klop, will lend her incredible voice and interpretation skills to accompany Olle in his, at times, lonley journey to meet Lillemore and other creatures. You will also find fable books and diaries to complement the game's exposure and narration. This being said, the game is great at what it is; the story telling is split into chapters, like any good book, and has the player follow a [b]very linear and established path, which will culminate in the same ending... every time.[/b] . The game’s pace is at first slow, then picks up and fully launches you into the experience.   [h1]Target audience:[/h1] While at first glance, the game may seem adorable and cute, [b]I would not suggest this game to anyone under 15 AT LEAST[/b]. The scenes this game hides within can be extremely heavy on the heart. Newborn babies get killed, extreme gorey scenes and sudden death animations out of nowhere. I would not suggest playing this with your nephew, niece, or younger siblings. Some themes pictured in the game are potently sorrowful and woefully charged, with extremely graphic content to go along with them.   [h1]Gameplay & game mechanics:[/h1] Gampelay is as simplistic as it gets in a story-driven game. Follow Olle on his adventure through lesser-known Nordic folklore and defeat several iconic figures. Do so by solving puzzles and avoiding dangers to tip-toe your way to the next area. There is no great gameplay with incredible gear combinations, nor is there some challenging mechanic for resource management or fighting technique to be learned. You are Olle, a little child in a fantastic world, and this is his story. [b]The game knows what it is[/b], what its genre is, and doesn’t try to be anything else; it is a great example of interactive story-telling where the player's hand is held through the whole journey to discover a great tale of ups and downs, of fear and laughter, of nature’s dichotomy in beauty and brutality. If you do not like games like [b]Inside[/b] or [b]Little Nightmares[/b], then this is not your game. Bramble directly feeds on this genre of interactive story-telling; if you want some action-packed game, move along; this ain't your style.   [h1]Variety of foes:[/h1] From the many Scandinavian folklore and ghost stories to John Bauer references, the game puts the player against many different creatures and bosses, always following a contained narrative. One of my favorites is Pesta, the personification of the plague, and Skogsrå, the gorgeous devil-tailed shapeshifter. Each boss belongs to a specific tale, being it’s defeat the end of said narration. Going from one boss to the next and walking through its story is a great way to learn more about Scandinavian lore. There are half a dozen bosses before the end. The bosses included in the game are [spoilers ahead]: [spoiler] The butcher, The troll, Näcken, Kärrhäxan, Skogsrå, Pesta, and finally the final boss, The mountain King.[/spoiler]   [h1]Gameplay length and replayability:,[/h1] [b]Lengthwise:[/b] I feel like in 5 hours I have completed the game and seen everything it has to offer. I took my time in every little scenario and felt like I saw everything, good and bad, although I missed some figurines. The game’s length must be one of its biggest flaws, but I feel like it ends in the right spot. Artificially lengthening the game might have led to a boring outcome. [b]Replayability:[/b] There is absolutely no reason to replay the game once the veil of mystery has been removed. I’d like to have more excuses than simple achievements to dive back into the game’s gorgeous worlds. Sadly, there is no incentive to replay at all, and obviously, there is no ‘New Game +’ concept. Replaying the game forces you to go through the same slow-paced sections, with close to nothing to explore aside from the already-heard tale.   [h1]The game’s biggest flaws:[/h1] When the player abandons the establish path or ryhtm, the enemies may bug out and scripted events may lose their impact. Like walls exploding by their own whill instead of zombies breaking them because they left after you stood still4. Some animations are a little flawed and stutter, but that’s just me nitpicking. Camera angles sometimes behave strangely. If you do not go the way the game wants you to go, the camera can flip out and confuse itself into a buggy scene. Limited or absolutely no power over the story. At least, several endings would’ve been nice to have. Short game with no replayability at all.   [h1]Conclusion:[/h1] Buy it when it's on sale. The art style and narration are flawless and enticing. If you like interactive story telling, this is your game 100%. The game contains some serious gore and grotesque content that may not be appropriate for younger or more sensitive audiences. I’d say this game deserves attention, but 30,00€ might be a bit much for a 5-6 hours experience. Sadly, the game suffers from the ""one use only experience"" syndrome, and this conditions my conclusion for the game’s worth in money.",1692544997,1692544997,1,0,0,0.0,0,1,0,0,1,""

Zwischen diesen beiden Extremen schwankt [b]Bramble: The Mountain King[/b]. Der Spieler begeleiter den 8-jährigen Olle, der eines Nachts feststellt, dass seine kaum ältere Schwester ausgebüchst ist. Was als ein harmloser Spaziergang im nächstlichen Wald beginnt endet in den tiefen heidnischer Sagen. Den schonbald muss Olle feststellen, dass seine Schwester von einem brutalen Troll entführt wurde, damit aus ihr ein leckeres Häppchen für einen gefangenen König wird.   Was zunächst nach einer 08/15-Fantasystory klingt entpuppt sich als verstörende Reise, die neben niedlichen Gnomen auch allerlei grausiges zu bieten hat. Während viele klassische Horrorspiele auf Schockmomente setzen, verzichten Bramble darauf fast vollkommen. Es sind vielmehr die Bilder und Geschichten, die einen echten, wahnhafften Horror beim Spieler bewirken. So muss sich alle mal durch die blutigen Fleischreste eines Trollkochs kämpfen, durch ein von der Pest verzehrtes Dorf oder durch die Seelen ermorderter Kinder. Das Spiel spart dabei nicht mit den grausigen Details. Wir bekommen alles zu sehen. Alles. Bemerkenswert bleibt, dass Bramdle trotz dieser grausamen Thematik zu keinem Zeitpunkt voyeuristisch wird. In jedem Moment in dem Olle durch die brutale Welt stolpert, fühlen wir seine Verzweiflung, seinen Schmerz, seine Wut, seine Angst. Zu keinem Zeitpunkt wollen wir verweilen. Davon ausgenommen sind nur einige kurze Phasen, in denen die dunkle Stimmung durch einen Moment der Hoffnung unterbrochen wird und in dem wir uns für einen kurzen Moment sicherfühlen.  Brandle lebt nicht von seiner Story. Es lebt von den Bildern und der Athmosphäre. Ohne eine beeindruckende Grafik zu zeigen, gelingt es Brandle eine Spielwelt aufzubauen, in der wir versinken, ohne es zu wollen. Untermalt wird das Ganze durch einen grandiosen Soundtrack, der zu jedem Zeitpunkt perfekt passt.   Spielereich ist Brandle die meiste Zeit Walking Simulator. Wir schauen vor allem zu. Unterbrochen wird dies vor allem dann, wenn ein Jump'n'Run-Passage kommt oder ein Bosskampf ansteht. Während ersteres spielereich kaum fordernd ist, sind die Bosskämpfe gelungen und im Stil der alten Schule gehalten. Wir müssen die Mechaniken durch Try and Error herausfinden und schließlich meistern. Das gefällt mir gut, gerade auch in einem so kurzen Spiel. Dabei ist unser Alter Ego mit Nichten unsterblich.

Das traditionelle Outfit des Kleinen ist eines von vielen Details, die eine wunderbare Atmosphäre alter Märchenbücher erzeugen. Die nordische Sagenwelt wird gelungen aufgegriffen und viele Figuren, die aus ähnlich platzierten Titeln wie z.B. [i]Unforgiving[/i] bekannt sind, tauchen in einer neuen, ergreifenden Inszenierung auf. Bewegt man sich zunächst in einer überwiegend zauberhaft anmutenden Welt, steigert sich die Dramatik und die Brutalität mit zunehmendem Spiel- und Handlungsverlauf. Das ist auch unglaublich wichtig, da es Spannung aufbaut und immer weiter ans Geschehen fesselt. Die Entwicklung des Protagonisten aufgreifend, verändert sich der zunächst etwas kindlich-naiv anmutende Grundton der Welt immer weiter zu einem bitterernsten und grausamen Drama, ganz im Tonfall alter Märchen und Sagen. Themen wie ritueller Kindesmissbrauch, Mord und Suizid begründen die USK18-Freigabe und die Triggerwarnung bei Spielstart absolut, verleihen dem Titel aber auch eine gewisse Würze.  Ganz klar ist, dass dieses Spiel von einer großartigen Grafik und Musik lebt. Bemerkenswert ist zudem, dass diese im Verlauf des Spiels tatsächlich immer besser, komplexer und interessanter wird. Vollkommen begeistert hat mich das Finale, das sich auch musikalisch zunehmend steigert. [spoiler]Während der Soundtrack zunächst sehr individuell klingt, entwickelt er sich mit jeder Boss-Battle-Stufe weiter, bis hin zu einer Interpretation des berühmten Themas aus Peer Gynt. Ja, der titelgebende [i]Mountain King[/i] ist tatsächlich [b]der[/b] Bergkönig aus dem Werk von Edvard Grieg, was mir zunächst garnicht bewusst war. [/spoiler] Ich finde es toll, wie diese klassische Gestalt so gelungen in einen modernen Videospielboss übertragen wurde.  Ein bisschen was zu nörgeln gibt es natürlich auch. Das Spiel ist äußerst linear, was mich aus Sicht der Handlungsführung garnicht mal stört, durchaus aber mit Blick auf die Levelgestaltung und Herausfordungen. Zwar wechseln sich die mäßig innovativen Puzzle häufig ab, so dass es interessant bleibt, doch hätte hier ein wenig mehr Handlungsfreiheit nicht geschadet.   Ein absolutes No-Go ist, dass alle Buttons in einem Kreissymbol statt ihrer physischen Tastenform angezeigt werden. Das finde ich  äußerst verwirrend, weil der Kreis visuell den Controller-Stick suggeriert und ich jedes mal erst nachdenken musste, welche der Buchstabenfolgen LS, LT oder LB gleich wieder welchen Controller-Button meint. Durch bessere grafische Darstellung wäre das - für mich - viel intuitiver.   Vor allem anfangs stört mich auch eine gewisse subtile Dissonanz und fehlendes Feingefühl in der Inszenierung. So wird der Wald von der Erzählerin als gruselig und angsteinflößend beschrieben, doch erscheint er grafisch eher magisch und einladend, keineswegs gefährlich. Das passt ebenso wenig zusammen, wie manche Tastenzuordnungen. Dass z.B. das Ducken (d.h. Figur bewegt sich [i]runter[/i]) einen Griff nach [i]oben[/i] (Bumperbutton) statt nach [i]unten[/i] (Triggerbutton) erfordert, fühlt sich für mich widersprüchlich an.   Einige Endbosse sind zunächst etwas knifflig, weil die Programmierung mit Auslösesituation arbeitet, d.h. wenn ""Skogsrå"", eine großartig inszenierte Femme Fatal des Waldes, zum Angriff schießt, so trifft sie scheinbar immer, wenn bei Abwurf die Spielfigur in der Sichtlinie stand. Ein Ausweichen in letzter Minute, das die Interaktion erheblich interessanter machen würde, ist damit unmöglich.  Aller kleinen Mängel zum Trotz, ist dies ein fantastisches Spiel, bei dem sich das Durchspielen lohnt, da es immer besser wird. Die Story ist kurzweilig, gut konstruiert und inszeniert und die nordische Sagenwelt wird sehr gelungen neu, aber dennoch traditionell interpretiert. Die Steuerung ist letztlich nicht all zu kompliziert und die Bossfights sind mit etwas Übung gut machbar. Auf jeden Fall eine Spielempfehlung!   ",1692438910,1692438910,1,0,0,0.0,0,1,0,0,1,""

The addition of some canon material about Veovis, D'ni, and then Rime, was really a nice touch as a hint for things to come or what you discover from the books.  Overall... still a beautiful adventure to enjoy.",1641664847,1641664847,1,2,0,0.54773873090744,0,0,0,0,0,""

О плюсах. Как переиздание - норм. Терпимая графика, норм производительность, любительский русик текста и текстур (с омерзительной старой озвучкой от Фаргус). Некоторые загадки приятные. Отличные записи в дневниках Атруса. Лично для меня было приятно узнать чуть больше лора, например, что та кристальная машина для наблюдения за Эпохами из четвертой части взялась не абы откуда - ее еще в первой части строил Атрус для наблюдения за Эпохой из части второй.  О минусах. Ну, во-первых, большинство загадок. Они безбожно устарели и решаются элементарно.  Во-вторых, так восхваляемая атмосфера оригинала, воспеваемая старичками и сетующими на то, что переиздание ее похерила. Собственно, скажу, что с переизданием все ок, тут как бы, атмосфера целиком и полностью наследуется от оригинала, а она там не очень. Большинство вещей совсем никак не вписываются и выглядят инородно. Многие загадки, в отличие от последующих частей, не создают впечатления, что здесь жили люди и они этим пользовались, наоборот, выглядит так, словно очередную вундервафлю поместили на твоем пути только для того, чтобы ты ее решил. Например - финальная загадка в звуковой эпохе, представляющая из себя катание в вагонетке по небольшому лабиринту. Нет того полюбившегося фанатам чувства ""понимания того, как загадка, как механизм работает"". Потому что тыкание пальцем в волшебную картину, чтобы она со звуком ""Вжууух"" открыла секретный проход это не есть ""понимание того, как механизм работает"". Ну и, путешествие во всю ту же Звуковую Эпоху не через книгу, а через изображение книги на мониторе в ракете, как бы тоже не идет на пользу атмосфере.  Как понимаете, минусы наследуются целиком и полностью от оригинала. Конечно, тогда это поражало и вызывало ""Вау!"" эмоции, но сейчас это просто... м-эх.  А, ну и еще есть ачивки, завязанные на впихнутой в переиздание ""свободной ходьбе"".  Да и ачивки вообще - порой не засчитываются, пришлось пару загадок дважды решать. Единственный минус переиздания.  В целом игрой доволен. С удовольствием посидел пару вечеров. Но вот рекомендовать игру бы не стал.",1641539626,1641539946,0,2,0,0.54356849193573,0,1,0,0,0,""

[17/20⭐, 8h🏅, 3/5💡]  [b]Context[/b] This one is tough to review. I had previously played the original Myst and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/macwh/recommended/63660/?snr=1_1056_1055_1056]Myst: ME[/url], but not any realMYST incarnation. So how should look at the value of realMYST: ME? As standalone game in 2021? A standalone in 2014 when it was released? realMYST: ME in comparison with non-ME realMYST? (Actually, never played non-ME realMYST and it’s not available, so this one doesn’t count) realMYST in comparison to regular Myst or Myst: ME? Or just the Myst family of games as an abstract concept?  Let me start with Myst in general for newcomers. At its core, Myst is essentially a sequence of mostly unconnected puzzles. What made it some innovative was that the authors were able to crafty build a credible world and lore around this, which still holds pretty well by today’s standards. In terms of difficulty, people often complain they feel lost due to the non-linearity and the lack of hints for solving the puzzles. In my humble opinion, non-linearity is a positive trait of this kind of adventure puzzle games. As for hints, I didn’t find any puzzle for which there weren’t clues and had to be brute forced. Granted, some of these are rather difficult to catch, and you need to be alert for every clue in the environment (including sound cues, got stuck a couple of times for disregarding this). The game is also rather short by today’s standards.  [b]Writing[/b] The plot is the same as the original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/macwh/recommended/63660/?snr=1_1056_1055_1056]Myst: ME[/url]. The player controls an unnamed character (The Stranger) that has fallen into a deserted age (the titular Myst). The player has to explore different ages to understand what happened to Myst and eventually escape.  [b]Aesthetics[/b] Focusing on realMYST as a standalone, for those who’ve never played the original Myst (or other similar pre-rendered games), the real-time 3D navigation provides a more modern experience without sacrificing much in terms of puzzle-solving. The controls feel natural, although I did encounter a few bugs (interactions that stopped working, elevators that stopped moving, stuck in rooms after controls stopped responding). In terms of graphics, I’d say they look a bit dated even for 2014. One that I think is subpar is the soundtrack (but that was already an issue with the original version).  [b]Gameplay[/b] For those coming from the original Myst, I felt the new 3D movement makes for a less frustrating experience when exploring the world, so I understand the need for this remake. (I went and re-played Myst:ME after realMYST:ME, and even though I knew what I had to do, sometimes I still couldn’t find the right place to click). I’ve tried the option to use classic point-and-click navigation in the 3D world and it didn’t really feel natural, even considering I was used to pre-rendered games. However, the realMYST 3D graphics feel more hollow, and the game loses some of “mystique” that was caused by the beautiful, sometimes eerie, pre-renders of the original Myst.   You can't die nor hit deadends, you can save at any point, and it also auto-saves.  [b]Value[/b] The game took me about 8h to complete. You cannot revisit previous chapters, but there are multiple save slots. Achievements are related to the progress and finding some hidden interactions, and don't require additional playthroughs. There are multiple endings, but determined by a last-minute decision.   PS: I’m pretty sure these are the only games I’ve played without support for subtitles. Considering that the spoken parts are from 90s live action footage with added interference, I can’t really understand this decision.

For those who have played Myst before, I don't know why you are reading this, you already know everything.  For those who like me haven't played Myst or realMyst before, I have couple things to say. I opted for this version instead of the latest remaster, and maybe I should have done the opposite. This game is a grand dad of modern immersive puzzlers and I can see it have done phenomenal job back when it was released. My issue though is that I haven't played it back then. At first I played Riven and Myst IV: Revelations, and got my hands on the first one only now.  I had the same issue with Silent Hill actually, because I started with Silent Hill 2. Compared to the sequel, original Silent Hill is really rough around the edges. And original Silent Hill games are also dated in terms of systems compared to modern survival horror games like The Evil Within 2 or Darkwood.   And it's the same when you compare Myst to Riven, and Myst to the modern immersive puzzlers. It's dated, and you gotta accept it.  But at the same time, there are clear reasons why people play Myst and Silent Hill even today. It's actually funny how two so completely different games are also so similar when trying to describe them. Even with how much more streamlined modern game design has become, both of those games did a revolutionary worldbuilding that still stands.  So, I have mixed feelings after playing Myst, since I can't say that I clearly enjoyed it because of it's rough edges. But also I can't say I didn't. Completed it in two nights, no regrets.

As a result, realMyst, alongside the 2021 version of Myst, are probably the best ways for newcomers to enjoy Myst in this day and age, unless you really wish to experience a classic, warts and all.  The most noticeable change realMyst offers is its actual 3D environment to move around in, with inclusion of both a classic-like point-and-click movement system and WASD movement, both of which feel good to use after adjusting to their quirks. As a result, it’s much easier to navigate the world and have more control in where one is going, so getting lost and not going where you want to go is less of an issue. The environment itself also transitioned well from pre-rendered pictures to 3D, with the animations and environment looking incredibly nice, with a few additional secrets to find.   Overall, realMyst is a great way for newcomers to experience Myst without having to deal with the most noticeable limitations and datedness of the original, with thinks such as in-game hints, achievements, and the new bonus age being additional fantastic quality-of-life additions.

A good upgrade compared to the original game. - Beautifully designed world. Unique buildings and some surreal locations with strong identity. A quick look at a snapshot and you know that this is ""Myst"". - Clever and well built puzzles. They are not too difficult but challenging enough. The original game was revolutionary at this kind of mechanical puzzles and inspired a lot of game after it. - Nice sound design on the environment. Puzzles' sounds are very helpful too. - Although it has not exactly a plot, the backstory that you read at the books is enough to succeed a dark, mysterious, weird atmosphere for the entire game. - Well written, interesting texts. You can read them all without getting bored. - Cool acting performances, although they are a bit extravagant. - Day/night system that you usually find in some other genres (e.g. open world) is a nice addition that offers more realism and enhances the atmosphere. - It has multiple endings. - It is clever that it throws you at the start of the game without explaining you anything about its logic and backstory. You have to discover it by yourself like a real explorer.  The bad - There are some navigational issues. At classic mode camera's movement isn't very smooth with constant unreasonable zoom ins - outs. It can easily cause motion sickness. At free modes there are some glitches in movement especially after interacting with an object. - The mouse cursor often does not change shape when hovering over some interactive objects and this can be confusing. Control mechanics at 1-2 puzzles are a bit clunky. - Although it has multiple endings none of them ends the game properly. There are no credits or something that tells you it's over.

The meat of the game is doing battle with teams of bad guys with your very own squad that you find through the story mode until you find Sophia the Recruitador (a lot of characters in this game have funny names). Then, the game branches into another way of playing it. You can capture any unit you fight on the battlefield when you leave it as the last one alive. There are several character classes from the human fighters to the penguins to the beefy giants to the cupcake healer class. Every character has their own name from Gluten to Pipistrella.  This is an early access title as of January, and it shows only in the story mode. The rest of the game is polished and balanced with each weapon type and class, but the story mode is farly short. What it lacks in length it makes up in character and gameplay. The narrator Stamper was present in their previous game Battleblock Theater as well but he takes the role of a godlike bear that overlooks the story as a sort of meta-narrator, talking to the characters and talking to the player. Apart from the short story quests, there are a few side quests that are all five parts incrasing in difficulty. These serve the same purpose as side quests in different games, to give you some more gold and flesh out the characters. These side quests take a bit longer than the story.   Apart from the insanely fun singleplayer, there exists an in-universe multiplayer PvP called the Pit, which is pretty much the only reference to the title of the game. You and a partner control your squads to defeat two other people's squads. It's a very satisfying game mode as you can learn from the other people's squad composition to increase chances of success. Think XCOM PvP. You get story rewards as well depending on how many games you win per day. As it is now, Pit People is very fun and well balanced even though the story mode was short and as sweet as the cupcake healer class.",1484620485,1486928117,1,209,10,0.923843801021576,6,1,0,1,0,""

I've recently completed story mode for Pit People (Yet to complete all Achievements, I WILL do it!), and the game has everything I personally wanted from the game. good Story development, a villian you can hate for a reason, and really funny jokes. With Early Acess, It has all the content for a small story, If it was only this for the final release, I'd personally enjoy it. Honestly I'm going to rack up my Characters to level 99 and completely MELT the Pit! Oh you're thinking of the 1000 Degree knife? The story adds on to the ""Behemoth"" Timeline. If you're wondering what game this is going off of, it's going off of Battleblock Theater. If you don't believe me, buy the game and beat it. Mechanics in the game are well-executed (personally, in my opinion). It introduces a Hexagonal Turn-base mechanic where you have to use Geometry to make any sense out of this.. (Note, you don't have to have that much knowledge). Will Stamper, there's Will Stamper. They got the legendary comedian Will Stamper. Just like Battleblock Theater, I might have a reason to beat the game. Unlike any Early Acess Games, I couldn't find any bugs when just casually playing it. It's well constructed, and like I said earlier, It feels like this is the full game. If you, the reader, are reading this, I highly recommend you buy this.  If you can spare $15, just buy this, buy this for your family, and buy it for your dog.",1484588887,1484620232,1,0,0,0.0,0,1,0,1,0,""

Всё в духе предыдущих творений от Begemoth, а значит фирменный юмор, отличнейшая рисовка, возможность весело играть в с друзьями на одном компе/консоли, и главное офигеннейшая озвучка присутствуют.  Сами пошаговые бои выглядят достаточно просто - никаких шансов попадания и кучи скучных всплывающих характеристик, все что нам нужно знать, мы видим сразу на герое - это сам герой и его экипировка, вариаций которой тысячи :)   Отдаем приказы перемещения всем героям нажимаем PLAY - и понеслась, каждый герой бежит в указанную точку и атакует ближайшего врага (да, да, нам даже не дают выбирать кого атаковать). Причем все это происходит одновременно для всех героев, что выглядит немного сумбурно и забавно, когда на поле в разных местах летят искры, брызжет кровь и отлетают цифры критов :) Затем то же самое делает противник. И так до победы :) После боя получаем ""ништяки"": золото, новые виды экипировки (например, меч в виде планки оперативной памяти(!), или метательные лампочки) и конечно же ""экспу""  На первый взгляд все выглядит просто, но разнообразие тактик достигается разнообразием героев и их умений. Самих героев можно вербовать, а можно брать в плен из врагов путешествуя по глобальной карте. Здесь же выполняем сюжетные квесты, достаточно забавные и юморные.

If you have played Castle Crashers or BattleBlock Theater, there are a lot of familiar things you will encounter - art style, humor and the narrator to mention a few.  Pit People does not necessarily innovate something new. Rather, it combines mechanics from many popular games and ends up creating quite an interesting result. You will feel the presence of XCOM, Fire Emblem, Skulls of the Shogun or damn, even Pokemon. Most of the time games mixing that many ideas would end up being bad. This is not the case with Pit People - it feels truly original.  The combat is plain simple but vast collection of different unit types and items make this game quite strategical. There are endless amount of combos to test and new interesting characters to find.  Lastly, I wouldn't be too worried about the Early Access tag on this game. Sure, most of the main story is missing (you can only complete about 5% of it) but there is still a lot to do in this version. There are multiple plot driven side quests to do, units to catch and other players to crush (in online mode).   Highly recommend.",1484557724,1484557724,1,0,0,0.0,0,1,0,1,0,""

A very interesting world, full of LOTS of stuff, like LOTS, complete with music, great sound, and mostly good controls The music is amazing, I'll have it stuck in my head for days. Behemoth has yet another wonderful game out on the market. On to some gripes about the game.  The PC controls are mostly good, but could use some fine tuning to make them not so wonky when selecting loadouts, the default controls are questionable, but rebindable so that's not that big of a deal. Also, in the intro, the load out screen and differences between ""tiers"" of items (i.e. cosmetics, light helmets, heavy helmets) isn't at all explained. It was super super confusing because I had no clue what I was doing. So the tutorial could use some more fine tuning as well.   There are other things not very well explained, like what's on the HUD, I didn't know what I was looking at, or what it meant for a while. The items, such as campfires, and how to buy them isn't at all explained. I think my #1 glaring problem was the lack of explanation, so if you're reading this, Behemoth, it would be good to look into that.  These are the most notable issues I saw, but damn this game is freaking fun. Doing Coop is sooooo much fun, but online is a mess. The biggest thing this game could benefit from is more flushed out tutorials, really explaining what everythng is. Keep it up Behemoth, it's a damn good game.

As far as content, UI, and fighting system, alot needs to be worked on. The fighting system is simple but shallow and there's two story missions along with a few side quests.

I feel that there quite lot to this game and it has had some great features over the years. With the multitude of official maps and community maps you shouldn’t run out of new experiences and environments. Single player is fun but most of your fun comes from multiplayer, mostly because of the verity you can find in servers. you meet a lot of interesting people in PvP and PvE and I personally have quite a few memories with my friends on all the different servers we have played on. If the surviving isn’t your thing then there is also the map editor which can be fun to mess around with, I find my self coming back to it every once and a while to mess about. Of course, there is thing that need to be fixed, the progression and risk can be improved and there could be a bigger emphasis on survival aspects like fishing and planting. I have also noticed that joining servers has become an issue.  I’m exited to see how Nelson takes this game into 4.0 and hope that it fixes most off the issues that the game currently has.

It's Double Dragon!  Uuuh...  It's... Double Dragon 2![/quote]  The Con's: [quote] It's Double Dragon 3.  Imperfect emulation. The game now moves far too fast for calculated or strategic play.  Off controls - particularly in DD2, where my punches will register as kicks.  Some of the remixes are either bad or downright god awful. The boss music in particular was an attempt to be unique by replicating the song with game noises, but it just sounds like complete nonsense.  Achievements are broken. I got one for riding an elevator that I know I hadn't, and one for using all the weapons, which I know I hadn't. With only 15 included, you think you wouldn't be able to screw it up.  No seriously, Double Dragon 3 being included at all. This game was complete dog excrement in every regard and it being included is like including Robocop 3 with a Robocop movie set - it's just something you shouldn't do, even for historical purposes.  Double Dragon 3, while a terrible game, is another huge missed opportunity by not having the three player version[/quote]  There have been worse and stranger ports than this, but it's still a bad port.

Bien les contare una historia acerca de mi trayectoria en este juego. Todo comenzó cuando lo conocí gracias a vídeos por youtube, mas concretamente gracias al youtuber hispanohablante Nexxuzworld, esto fue hace bastantes años ya mas concretamente a finales de 2016, desde el día que lo conocí me pareció un juego muy entretenido y siempre lo quise jugar, así es cuando lo compre, ya ni me acuerdo, pero eso fue con mi primer pc, el cual no tenia ni tarjeta gráfica (Ya me imagino como sabrán que termino) estuve días DÍAS para instalarme lo, varios dias, cuando tenia 10 años ricien cumplidos, ahi que deje mi pc encendido instalandolo... Cuando lo instale todo fue pesimo, tardo como 10 minutos en cargar el menu y me iba full trancado, cuando inicie partida todo en bajo, tardo como una hora en cargarme y cada paso que daba tarba como 4 minutos en darlo, en resumen me iba fatal... Pasan los años y me consigio mi segunda pc, mucho mejor que la antigua... con una GTX 1050 con la que me hice todas las horas practicamente, resulta que al comienzo por las 20 primeras horas fui jugador solitario de servidores normales, que siempre que me conectaba terminaba raideado y me enoje con el juego, claro era un bobo y no tenia una tribu... Asi fue como comence a entrar en servidores donde la gente era muy muy poca, y con mods, de hecho los mods fue lo que me salvo casi todas las horas, ademas de mi grupo de amigos con los que fui cambiando, y alli pase como 500 horas, ya tenia 520 horas aprox... nunca mas volvi a entrar a un server oficial, porque me dan asco, pero desde entonces solamente juego solo, abosulutamente solo pero con algunos mods para entretenerme y siempre juego en los mismos 3 mapas The Island, The Center y Ragnarok, se que añadieron otros, pero me volvi muy inactivo estos ultimos años a ark... 1000 horas que e jugado sin siquiera tener el pass, MIL HORAS sin haberme comprado el pass que tanto deseaba pero por problemas no tengo la posibilidad de tarjeta. Hasta ahora siempre e querido encontrar algun amigo en mi vida que jugara ark pero ninguno lo hace y siempre juego solo... siempre quice poder jugar otro mapas como Aberration, Extintion, pero no e podido porque no tengo le pass... pero tal vez algun dia lo compre...  Conclucion: Este juego es muy bueno, excelente lo cierto es que pesa demasiado, pero demasiado, sobre todo con los mods, pero lo recomiendo inmensamente, tambien es cierto que consume muchos requisitos, pero volvi a entrar con mi nueva pc a completar las 5 horas que me faltaban y ahora si lo pude jugar al maximo y se ve muy muy bien, desearia si alguien lee esto, que me invitara a jugar con su equipo, la verdad que ya aburre y tenga en cuenta que no tengo el pass ni ningun mapa comprado jejeje, lloro por eso pero bueno, nada que hacerle...

This is not a enjoyable game if you play alone. I recommend you to play with your friends locally. It's very grindy and repetitive that you are required to farm resources to set up you camp site. Time managment and food allocation can be tricky issues at the beginning and no explaination is given other than Kovacs's useless 'guides' but you will get better as you progress. Besides slaying zombies there is almost nothing you can do/interact in the very empty,boring world map , you have to keep taking quests from NPCs. And the story is meaningless as well.  But still, why the hell should I recommend this boring grinder to you? It's because it supports local co-op upto 4 guys. To work together with your friends is always the best way to survive. I did spend a lot of time discussing hot to build the best camp with my friends. And the crafting system is hard-core enough, it does make sense to me. You will eventually realise that there are a hell lot of things you have to consider as a survivor and communication in co-op mode is thus become essential. Always exchange ideas with the guy sitting next to you and find a way that both players can enjoy this game. In other words, Single play? NOPE.  Co-op mode?

Конечно случались всякого рода казусы (например мы могли запросто провлится под текстуры и...не вернуться), но мы эту игрули полюбили, поэтому выход второй части для нас стал радостой вестью.  С одной стороны, игра стала разнообразнее. Появился лагерь, который помогает вам выжить и по сути является вашим домом (вы можете его улучшать и даже выбирать место для размещения постройки). Миссии выполняются на отдельных (закрытых) картах и по достижению цели вы можете спокойно нажать на одну кнопку и вернуться за наградой. С другой стороны, появилось две ""прокачки"" - прокачка Вашего персонажа и прокачка ""лагеря"". Игнорировать их, мягко скажем, просто не получится, так как вы не сможете начать некоторые миссии, пока не прокачаете лагерь до определённого уровня. Как мне кажется, это не совсем адекватный ход, так как добавляет в игру элемент ""надо идти фармить"". И если на первых порах ты почти не замечаешь этого, то позже процесс развития лагеря настолько зависит от фарма, что игра начинает напоминать ""линейку"".  Однако истинной причиной по которой я пишу обзор является то, что разработчики до сих пор не починили систему ""сохранения"" и вы можете потерять весь Ваш прогресс. Так случалось у меня с другом 4 раза и отбило напрочь всё желание играть. Как это выглядит? Вы заходите в игру и обнаруживайте, что у Вас просто нет лагеря. То есть поляна чистая. Ваш персонаж становится первого уровня, однако у вас остаётся опыт для прокачки себя и лагеря, НО МАТЕРИАЛОВ ДЛЯ ПОСТРОЕК У ВАС НЕТ. Фактически Вам нужно проходить миссии заново. Варианты, которые предлогает разработчик в борьбе с такой ошибкой не являются эффективными.

The weapons are one of the reasons this game feels stale, mostly you got meelee, bows/crossbows and guns. The game makes you grind A LOT to unlock weapons, missions and upgrades. The level caps each 10 levels until you finish a special mission.   The game allows you to create you own camp... which would be nice if you didnt have to grind for resourses constantly to upgrade it. If you want new weapons you upgrade the armory, Armor? the accesories workshop, Potions? the lab. There is too many structures you will need to level up to keep up and they wil eat your time farming for resourses without it being fun.  The only fun part of building your base are the missions where you must defend the comm tower from zombies and you can get creative setting defenses and traps, but its really unsatisfying anyway for all the effort it takes to setup an effective base.  In the end, I cannot recommend it, the story is not that interesting, everything is centered around Kovac, no other character shines, the customization is very limited and the game feels very stale, stages only change after doing a lot of runs and completing many missions.  I guess they focused so much in creating a crafting and level system to try to make you feel progression they forgot to make the gameplay more fun, they limited the weapon diversity and ended up making the game feel too repetitive.  I even checked ahead (youtube) to see if enemies change to be more fun or something but nope, it remains basically the same for the whole game, but they add aliens at the end to try and make it more difficult... the combat has no variation though the whole thing.

Every aspect of the game I can of think is implemented so well that it feels like a crime to buy this for its current price.  The gameplay is so addictive, pumping your blood with adrenaline on each stage and pushing you forward. Even the lowest difficulty can at times bust your balls in case you play for score. And you should. The scoring system is what gives the game its seemingly chaotic nature, which a player has to conquer. And to do that you have to come up with a strategy for each stage and for each encounter. At this point fundamental simplistic gameplay design starts to show its true potential and depth.   The next primary drive of the game is the BGM, which is of the highest quality and fits to the action perfectly. The OST absolutely deserves to be listened to separately. The are no problems with the sound effects as well - every explosion and every power-up pickup feel distinct and satysfying.

It’s an extremely well-crafted game eager to blow your pants off with intense, frantic action. However, I must state that the game can seem overwhelming with the differences between difficulties. In fact, I think anything beyond “Experienced” will be impossible for me, but you can and do improve over time.  This game has a committed arcade design philosophy. You have numerous difficulties, different modes including co-op (with shared lives), and leaderboards for everything. The game’s Arena mode offers credits based on in-game performance used to customize your character and will occasionally throw challengers at you whose score you have to beat in order to continue growing your profile level. I definitely recommend playing some Arena so that you can purchase the bullet color that stands out the most to you if the default isn’t working out. I went with yellow which helped me process the visual information on the screen.  Single World allows you master an area, but Arcade mode is the one that puts you through the entire gauntlet. Each world only takes around 7 minutes for me to complete and there are up to 6 worlds if you play on Experienced. Rookie has 5. What keeps me coming back for me is the desire to achieve mastery due to how the game encourages an incredibly dangerous dance to keep your combo up and the fierce action constantly keeping me on the edge of my seat. You’re a very fragile being. One hit will kill you unless you’re able to collect a shield and you’re doing your best to evade hundreds of enemies and projectiles in every world.  Every world is broken into small levels. Some of those levels contain secrets which involve hidden humans to save, hidden multipliers to help build up your score, extra lives to keep you in the fight instead of using a continue, hidden targets, and secret entrances that take you to another level filled with humans to save and enemies to kill. In addition to the secrets and trying to stay alive against the relentless onslaught, you’re also trying to build up not one, but two combo meters. You have the regular score multiplier that you build up by killing regular enemies, special enemies, or finding them in the level. It doesn’t decay or go down unless you die and use up a life. You also can consider building up the human combo which works by saving a human, waiting for the combo meter to decay, and then saving another human which is very difficult to consistently do since you’re juggling so much information at once. You have to risk it to get the biscuit though and human combos are necessary to racking up huge points to make your friends look bad.  You don’t have to worry about it too much if you’re just trying to beat a higher difficulty and leaving the high score attempts for later. In fact, there are Feats (sorta like in-game achievements) for avoiding all the humans in a world. Don’t feel too overwhelmed and stick with Rookie for a while. Learn the placement of the secrets and enemy patterns before attempting the harder settings, I say.  Oh right, power-ups. They contribute to your overall effectiveness in different ways and dying means dropping one on the ground which you’ll probably want to collect. You’ll frequently encounter Triple Dash, Dash Explosion, Shield, Weapon Range, and Weapon Spread. Having all five at once grants you the 5-projectile spread shot instead of the 3-shot version with 4 out of 5 power-ups. There are also special weapon pick-ups with the Rocket Launcher being my favorite. Your controls involve moving with left stick, shooting with right stick, dashing with LB or L-Trigger, and using your special weapon with RB or R-Trigger. I highly recommend using a controller.  Whew, when you’re not in the zone and super focused on avoiding the cold embrace of death, you might notice the great soundtrack. Every song seems well done and fun to listen to while blasting baddies away. The neon colors also help immerse you in the retro-arcade design of the entire game. It looks good, sounds good (except for weapons which are understated a bit, but is still okay), and plays well.  Again, this game can be extremely difficult on the higher difficulties because faster enemies means faster reflexes are required and sometimes my brain can’t keep up. You can also find yourself in a situation where your run might be over because you’re caught in a death loop against a boss (remember, you lose power-ups on death and continues). It can be weirdly satisfying to take down a boss with just your basic gun and a special weapon, but that did take me around 17 continues which each one having three lives. The 6th boss didn’t even have a weapon to pick up though in its room and I just had to back out at that point. Make Rookie your best friend if you’re new to the genre or aren’t hardcore before making bold difficulty choices.  Still, I love this game very much. It’s my favorite of the genre and I recommend it with two thumbs up. It’s one of the few games that I’ll leave installed indefinitely because I know I’ll be shooting down thousands of more baddies in the future.",1503016131,1503016131,1,11,0,0.63994163274765,0,1,0,0,0,""

It still has a Very Positive overall ranking here on Steam but buyer beware, you may not be able to play this game.   My system meets all the recommended requirements and then some however the game is basically unplayable for me and for many others. If you check the Community Discussion you will see the main stickied thread plus many others from users like myself who cannot play this game at all or beyond the first level, let alone compete in the arena season. The game will crash immediately on loading a level or after completing the first level every time.   The problem seems to be related to those who still use Windows 7 not any specific hardware. I personally did not refund because immediately after the game was released the developer, Housemarque, was aware of the problem and attempted to fix it with a few hotfixes and one main patch. Unfortunately these quick fixes did not resolve the issue and those of us who waited for them to fix it without refunding were left waiting.  We're still waiting..   Three weeks since release and after a few attempts to fix the problem failed, the developer has apparently stopped supporting the game. Less than a month after release there have been no responses or developer support for the game since July 17, 2017 other than to say they are on holiday and still monitoring the problem. They have not provided any information on their discussion or news page and have apparently stopped trying or are unable to fix their game for Windows 7 users even though it is still listed as a supported OS.   The game (what I have gotten to play of it) is a fast paced, fun twin stick acrade shooter. Perhaps one of the best in a long while but that is also what makes it so frustrating for those who cannot play. I gave them the benefit of the doubt because in the beginning they were making attempts to resolve the problem but that support seemed to end about the same time as the refund period did. If you can play the game on your system then I would recommend it however with the way the situation has played out and the developer ceasing to communicate through Steam in over a month, I can only recommend you buy to try.. and be prepared to refund quickly if you're one of the ones for whom it does not work.  This is definitely a case of Caveat Emptor and a reminder to research the Community Discussion of a game before you purchase.  Update: A new patch was released 8/25/2017 that added a new language and a new leaderboard season but no fixes.",1502861401,1503716007,0,103,8,0.613176584243774,15,1,0,0,0,""

Aqui o(a) jogador(a) vai assumir o papel de uma verdadeira maquina de matar e deve destruir hordas e mais hordas de inimigos numa sequência frenética no melhor estilo SHMUP, mas com seu toque pessoal.  O jogo não conta com modo história, se quiser sozinho vai encontrar as opções arcade (conforme passa um mundo, avança ao próximo), mundo individual (você joga apenas o mundo que escolher) ou arena online (você joga sozinho, mas seu objetivo é bater as pontuações de outros jogadores). Os nomes estão em português porquê o menu jogo pode ser colocado em PT-BR nas opções.  Para quem não sabe, a Housemarque já tem experiência - e muito boa por sinal - com jogos parecidos e que contribuíam para o sucesso de Nex Machina, ex: Resogun e Alienation. Para quem já teve a oportunidade de jogar os games citados ou mesmo outros títulos da empresa, sabe muito bem o quão ela leva a sério seus projetos e podemos claramente ver o amadurecimento do estúdio com o passar dos anos.  Mas afinal, qual é a receita do sucesso visto aqui? Lugares que desafiam seu posicionamento, muitos inimigos, e bônus que vão exigir movimentações longas e desafiadoras. O jogo poderia muito bem lhe colocar num ambiente variado e deixar você matando, matando e matando, mesmo assim ele conseguiria sua carisma, isto é fato.  Sua movimentação, os comandos - teclado e mouse ou controle - estão ótimos, o jogo é extremamente fluído e cheio de recursos visuais que enchem os olhos com efeitos primorosos. As musicas e os efeitos com relação aos sons também estão em um nível espetacular, tudo se encaixa muito bem na proposta do game.  Não posso dizer que Nex Machina é pensado para computadores mais fracos, não é, seus efeitos exigem um bom hardware, mesmo assim sua taxa de quadros se mantem estável e talvez seja possível executar o jogo em configurações mais modestas, óbvio que o custo vai ser um dos grande pontos do jogo - a beleza dos pixels explodindo - e se isso não garantir uma jogabilidade - taxa de quadros ""fps"" - estável, melhor deixar para quando tiver um melhor equipamento, é impossível passar algum mundo com o PC travando.  Existe também a possibilidade de jogar cooperando com algum amigo, mas de forma local e com tela compartilhada, fato que rende uma boa dose de diversão e desafios, falando nisso... Os níveis de dificuldade do jogo estão equilibrados e crescem na mesma proporção, se busca completar todos os mundos no mais difícil, não pense em fazer isso logo nas primeiras tentativas, até mesmo por ser necessário treinar o reflexo.  In-game, além do desafios de atirar e se movimentar, também é possível resgatar seres humanos - o que rende pontos e conquistas - e não vá esquecer de coletar os objetos brilhantes pelo cenário, são habilidades/armas que podem ajuda-lo na destruição das hordas, aumentar sua vida, recarregar seu dash e até mesmo escudo, por isso é fundamental destruir tudo pelo mapa, muitas coisas estão escondidas.  Outro grande destaque é boa variação dos inimigos, a cada cenário você vai encontrar algo novo e desafiador, isso faz com que à estratégia e os movimentos usados anteriormente não possam simplesmente ser reprisados, então é preciso sempre estar se adaptando.  O que jamais pode faltar num título assim? Você já deve ter se perguntado. E os chefes? Sim! Legais, diferentes e difíceis - o que já era de se esperar - e claro que o jogo não decepciona na experiência que é enfrenta-los, tenha cuidado, use estratégia e principalmente seus reflexos, pois serão levados ao extremo.  Depois de tudo que eu falei, alguma dúvida de que recomendaria o Nex Machina? Lógico. Cada centavo vale a pena, os desafios impostos são ótimos, sons, gráficos... Tudo é muito bem explorado e demonstra a qualidade e preocupação do estúdio em dar aos seus compradores um excelente game. O único fato que posso lamentar é que não existe a possibilidade de jogar cooperando online com algum amigo.

As well, I had to redo two missions twice because of a saving glitch with was super boring and didn't get some achievements like beating the campaign or beating the campaign on hardened difficulty, it could have been the activation key I bought but I find that unlikely. This game was honestly just boring and draining and is nowhere near as good as Black Ops 2 or World at War which are the two other Treyarch campaigns I've played.

The bill enacted makes a person subject to a background check when they are trying to purchase a firearm from a federal dealer, manufacturer, and also an importer. Background checks are run through the FBI and go through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System(NICS). Other features of the Brady Bill are also prohibiting transporting firearms if a person falls under certain criteria made under the bill and prohibiting firearm possession if a person has a felonious charge.

The gameplay is pleasant and satisfying, challenging on the higher difficulties, and it made me want to improve to tackle ultra nightmare. The weapons range from basic to imaginative, like the grav dart launcher that can launch your enemies off cliffs or into walls. They are all fun to use and effective. You also get some cool powers, of which I primarily relied on a force push of sorts (kills people) and a divebomb. Driving is serviceable enough, and the wasteland is big, pretty and explorable. Hidden stashes and things are hidden in a lot of places unmarked on the map, so it actually pays off to explore what might look like a place of interest off the road somewhere.  Visually the game is pretty awesome. Maybe I'm not up to date on the latest games but RAGE 2 sort of blew me away a few times with the density of details in some areas. Whole junkyard basins full of scattered items, or the dense jungle region up north. And the basic desert areas look great as well. The DLC's overgrown city produced some stunning vistas, but the main game is no slouch either. Exploring the aforementioned jungle I found remains of a city with tall buildings, and eventually climbed up to have an amazing view south onto the game world. Definitely enjoyable to just ride around, explore and take in the sights.  The story and world and all that is probably the weakest part of the game, since it's all pretty shallow and it never really draws you into the world as much as it could. The structure of the main storyline is extremely gamey and you're a cocky overpowered protagonist, so it's just there to provide justifications and excuses to have fun in the wasteland.  I haven't been playing many open world games, so I definitely enjoyed that aspect of this one, and the freedom it offered, especially when I just came out of the starting area, was still impressive and novel. If you have even a tinge of open world fatigue, I imagine RAGE 2 would lose some of its appeal. There are definitely plenty of map markers to mop up, but I had fun doing that and I think I cleared them all out. The diversity helps. There's definitely only a limited number of types of things you get at the markers, but there's enough variety both in type and in scope. Most of the locations are also pretty unique, though you will likely spot a bunch of reused smaller buildings and the like, but that's not a problem in the big picture. The locations definitely feel hand-crafted and not copy-pasted. Though there are a few notable exceptions to that, they're barely a blip on the radar.  Summing up, I would most definitely recommend this game if you're not sick of open world games. It's nothing mind-blowing (apart from some vistas you can find), but it's high quality entertainment in my opinion. Who knows, it might surprise even open world veterans.

To start off, let me say that Rage 2 is a ""Meh"" game at worst with an ""Okay"" at best (6/10). The game honestly feels like a tech demo for DOOM Eternal. It has some solid gun play and movement, but I feel like it could use improvement on the fluidity of the movement & progression.  Pros:  - Solid FPS Combat System - Beautiful World and astecticly pleasing to look at - Interesting and unique vehicle types - Fun and solid Gunplay  Cons: - Boring protagonist that is super un-likeable due to his cockiness. - Under powered in the beginning with lack-luster arsenal which you have to unlock by venturing the whole map - BORING/LAME Antagonist. The ""Authority"" seriously? This is all we could think up? - RECYCYLED BOSSES & MINI BOSSES (Dear God save me!). - Reused Enemy types and assets everywhere you go (Insestous people roam the earth now I guess.) - Driving for 10 minutes for 2-5 minutes of combat. - Blubble Gum colour in the setting doesn't work well. - forgettable NPCs. I can't say anymore here as it's true. - Music feels half-baked or off for its setting. - boring side quests leaving you to focus on the campaigne. - Is a grind to push yourself through unless you're here for the combat. - Vehicle movement feels stiff and you easily find yourself going off-road and blowing up your vehicle randomly after getting out. - Just needed more time for debugging?  All in all the game is ""Okay"". That's all I can say. I wish there was a side ways thumb option because this is definitely a Mixed feeling review. I like the game, but equally dislike it.

The only real complaint I have about this game is the over-abundance of menu items and the unnecessary quantity of things to care about. Going from brutally lighting goons up and then maliciously torching muties is like taking an empty can of soda, heating it up, then dunking it into ice-cold water to watch it shrivel up and implode. I don't care much for leveling up the skills presented or collecting cars and other items. I just want to kill monsters and bad guys, something that DOOM 2016 did do splendidly. The game would have been drastically better if instead of having to scour the wasteland searching for skills, abilities, weapons, and items, they simply just gave you the arsenal and set you loose on a path of total destruction and carnage.

Сразу скажу, негативный отзыв исключительно за хамское отношение в плане ценовой политики, само по себе одновление я рекомендую. Итак: Главное, что мы теперь имеем, это механика лояльности городов. Что это нам даёт -- мы можем расширять свою империю неагрессивным методом, т.е. на практике у меня эпоха просвещения, а я не разу не милитарист, и при этом уже четыре города отхватил у соседей. И что удивило больше всего, что Ганди просто ""самоубился"" ))) Его столица взбунтовалась и отошла ко мне)). Как это происходит? Город расположенный в непосредственной близости от крупного города противника начинавет поддаваться его влиянию, чем крупнее город соперника рядом, тем сильнее влияние и тем скорее в городе будет бунт. Счастье в городах соперника, и менее счастливый наш город, только ускорит ситуацию. Таким образом противник и дальше может подбешивать вас неожиданным городом  в ""выемке"" территории между вашими городами, но удержать его врятли сможет. Кстати, после того как город поднимет мятеж, над ним будет мигать герб той страны, к которой через определённое количество ходов он отойдёт, поэтому  вы можете как терпеливо подождать , так и нестись с армией, чтобы захватить лакомый кусок, пока тот не отошёл противнику. Всё это одинаково работате и в обратную сторону... Достигнув момента, когда пора осваивать новые материки за океаном, основав город на прекрасном острове, полном изобилием ресурсов, я вдруг осознал, что не так далеко находится столица Нидерландов, а это значит, что их влияние на город несоизмеримо больше чем моё. Таким образом сепаратизм не удержать. И это логично, я считаю. Т.е. игра стала более осознанной. Ну и добавте сюда несколько губернаторов (там их пять или шесть), которых можно назначать в определённые города с целью их спецификации. Есть губернатор на усиление укреплений, на более сильный рост промышленности, на усиление лояльности... Также появились специфичные союзы, и критические союзы.  В итоге я не пожалел о покупке, но цена завышена, а посмотрите сколько они просят уже за следующее DLC?!  Таким чином проще вернуться на трекер.  P/s/ играю на марафонской скорости, так вот к тысячному ходу у меня ещё не разу не было тёмных веков или даже нейтральных. Я вобще не замарачиваюсь с этим, идёт как идёт, но пока постоянно золотой) К слову, если кого-то так напрягает это всё, механику дополнения вобще можно не включать при создании новой игры.",1546506534,1552234329,0,26,1,0.689563810825348,5,1,0,0,0,""

No change here.   When R&F launched it had some fundamental flaws. For instance the new Golden/Dark/Heroic Age system was neat but kind of ruined the end game. At the time it would leave you eternally stuck on whatever Age you were last on when you clicked the ‘One more turn…” option. As someone who can easily drop dozens of hours into Civ even after the main objectives are done this ruined it for me. If you were stuck in a Dark Age you were forever at a disadvantage. On the flipside if you were stuck in a Golden/Heroic Age you were always OP.   The reason I bring up the example above is because Firaxis took the feedback and directly fixed the issue in a follow up patch. This is an improvement over how they seemed to be handling the base game in 2017.      Civ VI review pasted from main store page below...  ""Changing my review from negative to positive after a year and a half worth of work on the game. Like most Civ releases the base game is usually in rough shape.

Покупая продукт 2К все время задаешь себе вопрос: сколько еще придется отдать? В случае с Civilization - всегда около стоимости самой игры.  И знаете, все бы ничего, да вот только это 2К. Изд(ев)ательство, которое требует продавать не пирог полностью, а отдельными слоями. Обычно это плотненькое дополнение к уже имеющемуся изделию.  Но в этот раз все иначе. Помнится, для Civilization 5 дополнение ""Gods&Kings"" придавало лоска, а ""Brave New World"" полностью меняло тактики игры.  Rise and Fall тоже меняет. Только теперь, вместо того, чтобы думать о победе, ты думаешь о довольстве и поиске ""очков эпохи"". Это становится своего рода гриндилкой этих самых очков - жертвуя равномерным развитием, ты пытаешься сделать что-то ""особенное"". В большинстве своем, полагаясь на интуицию.  Резюмируя, можно сказать следующее: [LIST=1] [*]Губернаторы? Всего лишь попытка сгладить недовольство в городах.  [*]Новые цивилизации и лидеры? Безлики.  [*]Союзы и критические ситуации? В условиях ИИ Civilization - лишь малозаметное разнообразие. [*]Политические курсы? Что ж, спасибо. [*]Лента хронологии - тот самый лоск, который хотелось видеть. Еще одно спасибо.

I do not have a lot of multiplayer experience with this expansion as few of my friends have it, so most of what I say is applicable to single player.  First off, loyalty.  This new mechanic makes it basically impossible for any of the AI to forward settle (this also affects your ability to forward settle, and while it can still be done it is a much more costly move than it was in vanilla).  If an AI does choose to forward settle you, you can expect a new city close to your capital, that you incur no warmongering penalties for taking.  It makes expanding take more thought to ensure you dont waste a settler, and it makes espionage a bit more interesting as the game progresses.  I should note that my games dont normally go past the early modern era so I cannot speak to how it affects the late game, but it makes the early game a lot more interesting, especially early game war as a captured city can rebel if you dont take out the capital fast enough, making for some interesing combat scenarios.  Next, the ages.  I would say this is the weakest part of the expansion (also it is incompatible most mods that alter tech/civic costs, so if you like to play with those mods make sure they are updated/made for R+F) as it adds the least to the base game.  In singleplayer ages dont really make a major difference, although I can see some potential for multiplayer with certain aspects like Dark Age policy cards, which give really strong bonuses at a great cost.  Whether you get a dark age or a golden age is supposed to affect the loyalty of your cities, but ive never seen it make a noticable difference.  One quick thing that has been noted in other reviews is that you cannot play the R+F civs in vanilla, so if you wanted R+F for the civs but dont want the other parts, than I would recommend looking for an alternative in the workshop.  That being said I love the civs they added, as they are all very unique and play differently than vanilla civs.  Also some vanilla civs have minor alterations due to some of the gameplay changes.  I would say that the new civs are my favorite part of the expansion.  There are also new wonders but they are pretty standard, just new wonders, both manmade and natural.  The new government system is probalby the best part of this expansion after the new civs.  Getting governors really changes up how you play, and they give bonuses that change how the game is played at all difficulties.  My only gripe is how one of the governors will give you envoys if you assign them to a city state, so you basically have to appoint them in order to stay competive before you get spies.  Government legacies are now policy cards that you get upon building the Government Plaza, a new district that has buildings you can contruct that will alter your playstyle.  You can also use a government legacy whle still having that government (+8 Oligarchy combat strength anyone?).  Alliances have been reworked and I really like what they did, as it makes international trading better than it was before, but it's still debateable whether or not to focus on internal trade.  They made it so there are 5 different types of alliance that each have 3 levels, so you are now limited to the amount of them you can have.  I like to play persia so I havent seen too much of the trading aspect, but it is definitely a nice addition.  There are also emergencies, which are basically temp alliances, but my games rarely go long enough for me to have anything to say about them.  Overall If you like the new civs, or are looking to spice up your civ games and change the way you approach civ 6, then this expansion does a good job, definitely get it on sale though.",1545901324,1545901324,1,34,2,0.779080808162689,0,1,0,0,0,""

It's worth its price just as it is, but if you have any doubts or your wallet is experiencing a Dark Age, wait for a sale or suitable bundle purchase.  The expansion is not without some shortcomings: Loyalty and Casus Belli systems both seem too forgiving or too punishing depending on which end of the influence you are. I found it very difficult to ever capture cities by pushing neighbouring citizens loyal to my civilization, AI seems to receive some kind of bonus for it, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Ultimately the expansion is almost worth it for the new civilizations and leaders alone (I hoped there had been more leaders for existing civilizations, but the overall selection available currently is more than sufficient), increasing nation variety, while era types and governors add new and fresh depth to long-term strategic gameplay of the original base game.

Z pewnych powodów około średniowiecza często wpadasz w wiek ciemny :P  2/ Lojalność – bardzo ważny dodatek ze sporym wpływem na rozgrywkę. W skrócie powoduje konieczność budowania imperiów z głową, prowincje odległe od naszych ośrodków mogą szybko się zbuntować i przejść na stronę innego państwa.  3/ Gubernatorzy – dla mnie porażka. System gubernatorów jest bardzo sztywny, awanse średnio udane, możesz mieć ich tylko kilku. W praktyce najbardziej przydatni do podnoszenia lojalności miast na obrzeżach.  4/ Rozszerzone sojusze – niezły pomysł, można złapać więcej nauki, kasy, kultury, religii. Sojusz militarny średnio pomyślany. Mogłyby mieć większy wpływ na rozgrywkę.  5/ Interwencje kryzysowe – pomysł bardzo dobry, jak zwykle jest problem z wykonaniem przez AI. Najczęściej kiedy grożą ci interwencje kryzysowe, i tak jesteś na tyle silny, aby nimi się nie przejmować. A za ich przetrwanie są spore bonusy :)  6/ Oś czasu – zupełnie nie korzystam i uważam za zbędne. Przydałaby się jakaś porządna kronika opisująca wydarzenia w państwie, bo z tej niewiele wynika.  7/ Nowi liderzy i cywilizacje – grałem najczęściej starymi, więc się nie wypowiem :)  8/ Nowa zawartość globalna – ogólnie ok. Zawsze lepiej więcej niż mniej budynków, cudów itp.  9/ Ulepszone systemy rozgrywki – też nie będę się wypowiadał, bo nie porównywałem starych i nowych systemów i doktryn, ale skoro nie zauważyłem różnicy, więc chyba nie ma jakiejś rewolucji.  Ogólnie i tak muszę polecić, bo jest lepiej niż w podstawce, ale ulepszeń (szczególnie w AI) mogłoby być więcej. Cena jest z sufitu. No i dlaczego nadal nie ma HALL OF FAME!?

Partie 1: le nouveaux contenu  Hormis les nouvelle civilisation qui sont de qualité variable, l'extension rajoute divers nouveauté au jeu comme l'âge d'or (qui est bien) et l'âge sombre (qui est un plaie), mais aussi l'apparition des villes libres qui peut créer des friction entre joueur humain, le pourquoi la ville se rebelle est bien intégrer et ne fais pas tache car il est possible de récupérer la ville si on se débrouille bien.  Partie 2: les points négatif  Bon, les points négatifs sont assez simple, l'impossibilité de jouer avec les civilisation de l'extension sans le mode (la règle) Rise and fall, ne pas pouvoir customiser soit même les règle comme enlever l'âge sombre et faire que les villes libres ne soit pas constamment en guerre, bref ils y en a d'autre mais ils sont surtout dut au jeu de base.

E.g. you select a focus in age 1 that helps you get points faster so you can get a better age at age 2...so you get get even more points and have higher chance at better age at age 3, et ceteral.  Actual effect on GAME ITSELF is less than negligible.  There is, however, major feature of the DLC: bugs. Dozens of them. Air carrier armadas are bugged, Fighters are bugged. Unit switching is bugged. Hell, what is NOT bugged? And packed with bugs comes yet another feature: you're basically unable to discuss them on forums - once you try you,  you get your posts deleted by moderators with absurd excuses for reasons.

For example the I had built a Iibrary and got the ability to create a university, I built two of those. A few days later there was a power outage, so the game was unexpectedly closed. I built another library and unlocked... University! That should have been observatory! But the cost for the library increased any way. - Another example is that the paper lady (the one that you have to pay 25 gems when starting a new game plus 1) pops up after each crash asking whether I want to get her help for 0 gems. This is probably related to the previous bug. - When the ships arrived and you send them again via the notification -> updates, it is sometimes not possible to click the notifications button, it just won't react. You'll have to click another menu item first. - Master of Time achievement is broken! I used each time stone at least twice by now. Prove is in the stats page.

You build ships to explore for more mines, towns or treasure.  You can also sell your resources to the towns you find.  You build different buildings which open up even more buildings.  It is so much more enjoyable than just clicking on something to make money as most clicker games are.  The one negative I have is when there is more than two things on a list I can't seem to scroll down to see the others.

First of all I want to say that the negative reviews here are most likely from people who didn´t give this game a proper look.  [u]What this game is about:[/u] Castle Clicker is an Idle/active Clicker game like the other Clicker games you probably know already. You click on things and get something. This game is about collecting ressources and then building stuff with collected ressources.   [u]PROS: What this game offers:[/u] [list] [*] Building and increasing ressource pools as you progress in this game [*] Sending ships out into the unknown to discover new mines (Stone/Coal/Clay/Iron/Gold/Marble) [*] Sending ships out to discover unknown towns, so you can trade your ressources for gold/ressources [*] Sending ships out to discover treasures to find chests which can contain great stuff (Ingame currency, many ressources) [*] You can play actively with clicking (or get an autoclicker lol) and you can assing up to 100 workers at the same time,  which come from your population, to do the job for you while you watch or when you go offline [*] New Game+ feature when you achieve building all the buildings, which results in a ""soft reset"" where you can build better buildings : Note - you keep your ressources and all your buildings, but you can build improved versions of buildings which give you much more ressources etc. [*] A level up mechanic where you can decide what bonuses you get from leveling [*] A sort of Skill Tree where you can decide which workers (Sailors, Miners, Builders, Refiners) improve, meaning your Idle workers get more stuff done, so you can skill to fit your personal playstyle [*] There are microtransactions BUT they really don´t give that much of an advantage (only the once buyable Support Coin for 3.99$ gives +50% XP and 25% faster ships, both stats are available while leveling up or can even be pushed with buildings) [*] You get a lot of Gems (Premium Currency) for free while tapping [*] There are certain types of Gemstones which let you boost worker efficiency and even stones that can change mines (example: you can turn Stone Mines into any other ressource when you unlocked them), there is even crazy stuff like Timestones which lets you fast forward time up to 1 day (really neat, got 2 already for free) [/list] [u]CONS: What are the cons?[/u] [list] [*] Can feel very slow to get into the game [*] Not knowing what to level up can result in frustration once you know what´s better suited for your playstyle (NOTE: there is an option to Reskill your worker levels by using 15 Gems, it´s not hard to get those) [*] As with every Clicker game there is a certain ""Wall"" at some time, meaning you will be stuck at some point until you overcome this hurdle [*] When using an Autoclicker the game seems to cap at 10 clicks per second [/list]  So far that´s what i´ve experienced in this game.

It wasn't for me personally, and I don't recommend it unless.  1. You like space games and difficult controls 2. You have A TON, like A TON of patience, because this game will make you get stuck many times scratching your head. It has a ""good"" story but the story is buried in so much frustrating exploration (it isn't even fun exploration in my opinion)  If you want a good sci fi, exploration game I would recommend much more Prey, that game has also a lot of mistery, better space suit controls, you have characters you can connect to, the ending is great, the combat is also great and the enemies are a good challenge to beat with the weapons you begin to unlock along the way. It is also an exploration game that invites you to jump and jetpack through space, to investigate and discover what happened around you.  So for me, the problems on why I didn't like the game are these:  FIRST, the controls on the spaceship and the space suit are really uncomfortable, literally uncomfortable, I know they are ""realistic"" but in my opinion that doesn't equal to fun.  SPOILERS for a game mechanic.  SECOND. The loops I begin every time make me feel like I have to rush through each loop to make anything done, and I hate that feeling of getting rushed, and there were times where I searched everywhere but the loop ended and I started from the beginning frustrated. Also, the space fuel and oxigen adds to that rush feeling and it made me feel both rushed, bored and frustrated to play each loop.   END OF SPOILERS  The game began to lose my interest as more time passed and no matter the ""discoveries"" I made, instead of making me feel accomplished like Dark souls games after beating a hard boss, or ending a good story game or visual novel, with this game, each time I got a new, minimum bare bones of information, I just wanted the game to go to the credits.  There's not much to do in the game more than use the space suit and spaceship, and you have a translation tool that gives you the tiniest bits of information until you ""get the pieces"" together..... the other  tools are ok but boring in my opinion.  So that's it. The story I guess it's good but the game got sooooo boring after hours of being stuck (I never used a single tutorial to finish it, I did it all by myself) and hours of just exhaustion from being done with the controls that by the end of the game I was more glad instead of ""enlightened"" for finishing the game. I also never cared about anyone in this game, because there's no one for the most part, and the messages some uhmmm, let's say ""ghosts""  leaved behind are...meh, again, just minute discoveries that felt more like a chore rather than something that feed my curiosity.   I recommend this game for those people who want a lenghty good story, but be careful with the controls as in my opinion, they're bad, very bad. realistic, but bothersome, use controllers if you can also. Hopefully you don't get as annoyed like me with the game, I guess it was not for me, but still, I cannot recommend this game but for some people who really like space  sci fi games; or the game is on  some heavy discount so you can check it for yourslef like I did out of curiosity, beware of boringness though. Aside form that, I recommend you to check prey instead.   ",1607497727,1607542592,0,4,1,0.444067806005478,0,1,0,0,0,""

There's something to be said about the difference between a 60 hour game with good experiences versus a 20 hour game with unforgettable experiences. The leap in design between this and its contemporaries is comparable to Half-Life amidst arena shooters and Portal among puzzle games.  Truly, I've never played something so full of discovery in just 20 hours, and that is in large part to the game's primary conceit: The 22 minute loop.   To those that do not know game design theory, almost all gameplay can be broken down into 'loops' of action by the player. Famously, Halo developers (notably Jaime Griesemer of Highwire Games) used the phrase ""32 seconds of fun"" to describe Halo's combat loop; fans of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim describe the loop of that game as ""Quest, explore, kill, repeat"" with both derision and praise. Outer Wilds takes the concept and runs with it, asking 'what would happen if the game's loop was 22 minutes long, while also being diegetic and story encompassing?'   Now, this isn't a spoiler--avoid all spoilers and guides, by the way; this is a very rewarding experience to go in blind for--but your character is stuck in a loop of their home star going supernova. The gameplay loop, in a design sense, is to explore this galaxy and find a way to stop this event from happening. As far as in-game progress goes, the only guidelines you have for progress is a shipboard computer that catalogs all discoveries made across all loops. The defining feature that provides a throughline for your journey is [i] you, [/i] as in you the player, and your accumulated knowledge of this system. That's it. No hand-holding, few hints, just your ability to piece together this quite expansive story non-linearly. It is one of the most cathartic and rewarding experiences of discovery I have had in my career as a game developer and my time as a player of games.   That's not even talking about the story or the music. There's a reason the latter has a DLC purchase option. It's good. So good it'll be on your spotify, your phone, or whatever means you have of music listening for the next week or longer. There are works so moving in this that it encapsulates entire themes of this game and brings me near to tears in just a few notes. If you're reading this review after playing, you know the particular song I'm talking about. The story, in turn, is so complicated and fascinating that you could spend days just piecing together the histories of an extinct alien race, your own contemporary compatriots, and the reason for this catastrophe into a comprehensive timeline. Though you only have 22 minutes of exploration per each loop, it feels like there are at the very least sixty times that amount of time worth of content and you'll end up wanting to explore every moment. You will want to meet every character multiple times just to see how they change throughout the loop. Those interactions are so powerful, so thematically justified, that they will stay with you for months. If you want my advice, talk to Chert on Ember Twin at different points in the loop and your discoveries. Their arc is both the most subtle and most profound in this entire medium of expression.  Someone before me said this is a once in a lifetime game and I have to agree. This game is art. Pure and simple. To expand on that, though, this is a once in a [i] genre [/i] type of art. I mean that as, if you were to quantifiably define an entire means of expression in art, such as certain modes of paintings, scores of music, or films, you may choose a selection of works to do so; The Outer Wilds is that for video games. Genre defining. Not as a buzzword, not as marketing, but as a description as to what is possible with this medium. If a cynic told you games cannot be art, this is the  example as to why that cynic is wrong.  No matter the price you pay, this game is worth it. I payed for it on a winter sale and it is the only game I've ever purchased that made me wish I payed more. Play it, explore the Hearthian system time and time again, and learn something about yourself in perhaps the greatest video game of all time.",1607448464,1607448464,1,0,0,0.0,0,1,0,0,0,""

I should start this review by saying that there are people this game is not for. Outer Wilds has been compared to a walking simulator. I completely disagree with this stance, but can agree that there are many points in the game where you will: - Allow the game to take you through the story - Simply walk/fly around and admire the sights/atmosphere - Explore areas just because they look interesting/haven't been seen yet - Read and ponder in-game text - Put down the controller for a bit just to think through puzzles - Feel accomplishment by working through a grand mystery - Work around a timer (Though the timer has no punishment and is very lax. But, you may lose a few minutes of gameplay or feel pressured occasionally)   If you can't get behind the above, the game may not appeal to you. You will be doing the above for most of the ~30 play through, and if a chill gaming session will bore you, this game may too. You won't be shooting at things. You won't have an adrenaline filled session. You won't be hopping out of your seat.  Now, why is Outer Wilds one of the best games I've ever played? If you find that you are the type of player who will: - Get engrossed into a great story - Allow yourself to feel discovery, freedom, fear, and dread - Appreciate a very intricate and atmospheric experience - Enjoy exploring space, as well as a large/busy game world - Thrive in non-linear, open gameplay - Take your time in the game environment and be patient - Enjoy reading text and using what you've learned to connect the dots  There is a lot here for you. Download and play right away. Thank me later.   A good comparison is Subnautica, which had a similar exploration theme. Still, the story and events of Outer Wilds was mind-blowing (If you will allow a game to blow your mind) and changed my opinion of what the exploration genre can be.

First off, if you get a couple of hours in and you hate this game with as much of a spluttering vehemence as I did, then go and have something to eat (I had a pizza and watched the Moomins), and come back at stop trying to get  on with the woeful controller controls, and just use m&k instead. The whole game feels like a complete chore on the controller that they so highly recommend on the startup screen, and honestly it's not like m&k is even messy. I hated every second I played because the clunky controller scheme is just not my bag at all (devs plz add invert x-axis, there are dozens of us. DOZENS!)  Changing controls changed my entire perception of the game. It was no longer tedious going back to the place I'd just been to and died at, because I wasn't dicking around and blowing myself up trying to land, and I was actually making gradual progress, exactly the kind of progress you're MEANT to make in this game. When tedium is replaced by some even small modicum of success, it all stops being a chore and starts being very moreish. It's like an interstellar tube of Pringles® (Pringles give me free stuff). I'm not sold on it being ""the game of a generation"" that some people are touting it as, but I'm only 3 hours in and I guess I'm just glad everyone has stopped banging on about the Witcher 3.   At the minute I'm not looking forwards to what I think is about to happen gameplay wise, but I absolutely will be driven by the story to complete the journey, although I dread to imagine how many passes I'm going to have to make in some areas (I have enough problems with brambles elsewhere. Don't ask.)  From a technical stand point, I'm not sure why my (admittedly 3 year old, but it's still rocking a 1060 so it's hardly a sack of potatoes) Razer® (Razer give me free stuff) was lagging. Seemed to clear up a little after a while, so maybe it was a background process causing problems, but I had to drop off some settings to get it to stop janking about like a janky thing (which was also killing me at times), and I can run much more visually demanding stuff with no bother.

You will die. And nevertheless life still manages to be beautiful.   Maybe even meaningful?  To be precise, you will die a lot. As an intriguing mix of the movie [i]Groundhog Day[/i] and every childhood's astronaut phantasies, the game's setting tosses you out into a sandbox-like miniature solar system caught in a time loop, where you as a member of the Hearthian race leave your tiny, cozy village to follow the footsteps of the pioneers before you into the dangerous Outer Wilds. You will be able to explore anything your eyes lay their gaze on (& your flimsy junk-ship can hopefully reach)... until the sun goes supernova. Yes, this [i]will[/i] happen - in 22 minutes, to be precise - and you will be there to stare at the chilling view. Until that happens, you are free to choose what to do with your free time. Welcome to Existential Crisis - [i]Outer Wilds[/i] edition.   The game has a lot to offer in this regard, and quite rarely was the author of this text instilled with such primal fears and such amazement in such a short span of time in a game. Apart of the inescapability of your glorious death, the fear of the vast, dark void surrounding you (and even [i]approaching[/i] you - Black Holes, anyone?) is only the main of a long list of ticks the developers aim for troubling the animalistic brain part of yours with.  The planets follow the laws of Newtonian physics (with a touch of quanta), and you yourself will abide them while visiting every celestial body and synthetic anomaly you become aware of. As time flows onward (even though it will soon reset), all locations change and evolve, and places you just visited may be unaccessible in a few minutes or don't even exist anymore, and vice versa.  This fact is important, as the aimless wonder about the cosmos around you is soon to be replaced by a mystery tale about alien precursors, which visited your planets thousands of years ago. If you wish to uncover the secrets lying behind the source of the time loop - and not roast marshmallows at a fireplace on the moon next door, listening to the happy tunes of fellow Hearthian's instruments while the Universe revolves around you (you can do both, to be honest) - you will need to plan accordingly where and when to go. With your rust-bucket of a spaceship, or without.  It's a tale about death, inevitability & loss. It's also a story about love, companionship and the unending wish and strive of living beings to explore, to create, to do good & to [i]pass it on[/i]. In this sense [i]Outer Wilds[/i] isn't only an adventure spaceship simulator, but also a sweet-bitter, beautiful experience of a lifetime.

When I read that this was an exploration and puzzle game, I was expecting something completely different than what I got.    I love the design, the setup, the world, and the atmosphere, but the actual gameplay is incredibly stressful (something I usually don't say about exploration/puzzle games...). I'd been hoping for a relaxing and immersive exploration game with traditional puzzles, but the puzzles in this are more like ""make it to this exact spot at this planet at exactly 5 minutes in or your route will be blocked."" And with the somewhat clunky controls for the spaceship, it makes it that much harder to be at an exact spot at an exact time.  There's no time to really take in the scenery or the cool worlds because you're constantly just trying not to die/close yourself off under extreme pressure.  Missed a single jump in a long platforming sequence? You're dead and have to restart.  Autopilot screwed up? You're dead and have to restart. Spent too much time on a planet? You are now trapped and will soon be dead and have to restart.  Didn't land the spaceship the right way? You're dead and have to restart.  Ended up in a spot on a planet 30 seconds too late? You're dead and have to restart.   There's never a feeling of accomplishment when you DO get through any of these events because you just know that 30 seconds later you'll trip up on something else and die, and then you're back at square 1 with nothing to show for it, having to rush to make the journey back all over again. To make it worse, the game doesn't even save things like text you've decoded on walls (which just looks like meaningless swirls until you read it), so you find yourself re-reading the same text over and over again because the game doesn't make any indication that you've read it on a previous timeloop. All the game developers would've had to do is make the swirls a different color once read, but they chose not to do this and a lot of other things that would've made players' lives a lot easier. The ONLY thing preserved from loop to loop is your ship's log, which just contains a lot of vague and inscrutable clues.   The most important thing to me in a game is that I'm having fun, and it's just not fun at all for me when an exploration game actively tries to thwart my attempts to explore at every step of the way, with a crazy sense of urgency and very little room for error.",1607221031,1607221031,0,4,0,0.494121819734573,1,1,0,0,0,""

This game and Bloodborne are hailed as the crowning jewel by the FromSoft community but I just don't get it. It's one of those games where it's cool to watch someone else play it but its pretty miserable when you're actually playing.   Game is pretty clunky with prompts such as the rope dart or ledge grabbing not being responsive or just not really appearing even though it should.   The game is obviously designed to make you learn boss and enemy patterns by making a lot of attempts but it punishes dying much more severely compared to other Souls-like games by making you immediately lose half of your currency and XP with no opportunity to recover it which I find to be a baffling decision.   You're also forced to go through certain areas again or kill surrounding enemies before attempting a boss/mini-boss every time you die to them so it got repetitive very fast for me.

There is now a lot of agency in choosing which encounters you face with which officers, deciding which routes to take on the star map, and the combat seems to have a lot more depth than the original rock-paper-scissors I remember.  Around chapter 4, the story got very interesting for me. I recommend this game on sale -----------------------------  There doesn't feel like there's actually a lot of agency in this game. Most of the interaction events are a yes/no check on skills that officers carry. Not a lot of interaction there for a game touting story. I'm at the end of Chapter 2 and the story is really underwhelming thus far.   Combat is interesting at first but quickly becomes repetitive, it tries to bring RTS into the mix but it falls really short because again- no agency. Your options and abilities to deal with the various threats that ships present you are incredibly limited by the scarcity of the campaign and RNG of what rewards you receive.   The combat revolves around drones your main ship sends out, and these smaller units are set up in 3 classes with a Rock/Paper/Scissors style of balance. This is probably the worst design choice of this game. After the initial ship choice, you don't really have the ability to alter strategy or unit composition, as resources are limited and you cannot construct or repair your own drones.  The rogue-like portion of the game is also rather lacking in agency. You can randomly find events to upgrade your officers, allowing you unique combat abilities and extra dialogue skills... but since you can't choose your own, this is also heavily RNG based. There's nothing to actually do outside of combat either except for click repeatedly and hope for good RNG.  Outside of the combat, which would be nice if you could alter unit class on the fly, this is inferior to FTL in almost every way due to the lack of actual control you get over the game. You're just clicking through dialogue, dying, and restarting until you get good RNG or have memorized the event results (they do not seem to have multiple results- each event will occur the exact same way every time).",1576135462,1605912039,1,0,0,0.52173912525177,0,1,0,0,0,""

Usually a combo of the two. However, sometimes, the greater art is actually being restricted from god-tier control, yet still simulating a realistic role of leadership. Crying Suns (great name btw) is an absolutely stunning Admiral simulator RTS roguelike FTL-lite.   The jumping beacons and targeting baddies is unfortunately immortalized by FTL, but is a great mechanic executed well here. But in the end...you are an admiral of a battleship. You can tell where your planes go, you can tell your cannons what to target, but you are the admiral. You watch your men die because of your decisions. You don't point the literal gun. That is one element of the storytelling that is done so well here. It helps you feel like your decisions will trigger things beyond your control, and yet you have to forge on.  Cons: Restarting every sector with the same gear and weapons and squads available is truly a grind. The novelty wore off pretty quickly. It is straight up obnoxious when looking at replayability. Plus, while the ships are interesting, there is an acute lack of battleship to battleship combat (which would be cool), and each ship is basically hyper specialized in one or two types of formations of squadrons and weapons to use, meaning you will always be relying on a similar build/rng for 6 sectors.  Aside from that, the visual style of this game is unbelievably good. It's in the tiny details, the way the screen rotates around a systems sun, the way light bounces off your crew's faces on the bridge...incredible. I love the pixel art. Just buy it to enjoy the art. But seriously, great game. Events and battles are a touch repetitive, but your enemies loadouts demand multiple thought out strategies from you, and you're forced to learn.

However, 343 industries might be one of the single most incompetent bunch around. The menus are terrible, the social part of the game has been completly butchered and they ruined the customisation by streamlining the progression system.  As for the game itself, well the campaign is the worst out of all the halos up to the 4th installment. It does start off great but just falls appart, failing to instill any sense of urgency to the player. Also, there isnt a single lovable character. The spawns in multiplayer are laughable, and the footsteps barely make any sound, which sucks for SWAT for instance. Why would i hear someone mouth breathing like crazy, but i wouldnt hear them running in their 2000kg armor? As for the ingame stats, well i've never seen someone fail THAT hard at making stats. Pretty much everything's wrong. Is it so hard to track? Even my KD's wrong. How can you fail a KD ratio?  For 10 bucks, it's a steal, that's the only reason i'm recommending it. 40 euros for 6 games, 3 beeing among the top fps games of all time, well it's completly worth. Even if they completly failed the ""social"" part of the game.  Edit 17/03:  Halo CE: The campaign is a masterpiece. The story, the music, the layout of the missions, the AI, it's simply in another realm of videogaming. Far better than Reach. However, the multiplayer has aged and, in my opinion, is barely enjoyable. I could blame the maps, the weapons and whatnot, but what really is the problem for me, is simply the lack of recoil when you get shot. It makes the whole experience bland. And no nostalgia helmet's gonna help with that. Also, there barely are any players on the game right now. Thanks to a lack of any actual events by 343, and a rushed release of Halo CE. Still, again, for 10 bucks, it's a steal. Also, 343 adressed a few of the problems (allowing rebinds for the mic key), yet too many are still in the game (crashes for instance).  Edit 14/05:  Halo 2. God damn does the campaign disappoint. My memories of the game were fuzzy, but i remember having a bitter taste in my mouth. Mostly because it was on pc and i had to use a 3rd party exe to play on xp, but now i remember. There's just too much waiting time, the weapons feel odd (especially the shotgun), the floods are insanely strong, the ally one shot you melee, the checkpoints are random. Compared to Halo CE, it's just a completly different experience, and in my opinion a lesser one. I've not played the multiplayer yet, but i dont think it's gonna be on par with H3 or Halo Reach. As for the port itself, well it's bad, as expected. Bugs, poor performance, crashes, and atrocious decisions taken regarding the UI, you know, the usual for 343. However, the remaster in itself is surprisingly good. The original game's esthetically bland, with washed up colours,  lack of majestic environnements, it's overall disapointing compared to CE. And the remaster version is the exact opposite: it's colourful, lively, and grand. The cutscenes are simply jaw-dropping. There's nothing more to say, it's just beyond amazing. So, the port's bad, the remaster's good, the base game is worse than i remember, overall, it's meh. I wish i could find my nostalgia googles, but it seems they dont fit anymore.  edit: 10/08 Halo 3: For some the best game of all time, and it's not even close. It's not my case. Althought  I have to admit the game still holds up very well, even to this day, it's not on par with Mass Effect 2 for instance. The campaign is just great. It scratches the ""two playable characters"" part from Halo 2 which in my opinion was poorly implemented (every single of the arbiter mission was bad) and focuses back on the Master Chief. A great choice. While the dialogues have clearly lowered in quality, the momentum, the energy, the set pieces, everything else has jumped to a completly new level compared to Halo 2 and I'd say, it almost reaches Halo CE level of quality. As if that wasnt enough, the multiplayer is simply amazing. Just like it was back in the days. It honestly didnt age one bit and the change of medium doesnt really affect it too much..... Now now, not everything's good in the Halo universe. Why? Microsoft. Those money hungry bastards keep pushing out half-baked games to get them all out before the release of their latest shitbox and their flagship game Halo Infinite. So we get bugs. We get awful hit-reg. We get lazy skins and lazy challenges. We get buggy achievements. And it's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking because, for once, 343 isnt doing such a terrible job. Granted it's a simple port to PC and pretty much everything they have added is either buggy or bad (the UI is one of the worst i've ever seen), they are actually trying to do it the right way. It's just sad that they took so long to start working on these ports and are now compelled to release them plagued with bug.  edit: 28/10  ODST is completly different from a regular Halo game. The ambiance is completly different, and so is the tone of the game. The gameplay, while at the core similar to the main games, has been tweeked to fit more to an ODST soldier than it would a spartan. The soundtrack is amazing and, again, very different from what we are used to in Halo although some of the tracks in Halo CE had the same moody feeling. I've got a few grips with ODST though: first off, it's far too short. Yes, it introduced the firefight gamemode but still, it's far too short. I didnt even try to get it, and still got the achievement for completing the game on legendary in less than 3 hours. Secondly, the characters. What they did pretty well in Halo Reach, they failed here completly. Although independtly from each other those characters are decent (well, we dont rly know much about them but at least they arent obnoxious), the way they interact with each other feels like it's been written by a 12 year old. I'm not saying the other games are better in that regard, but since in the other games the characters dont really interact outside of cutscenes, one cant really see the lack of depth in their relations. Thirdly, and it's my personal opinion, i did not like the way the arenas were built. I know those were made with the fact that we play as an ODST in mind, but it lacks variety. And so do the enemies. Most missions were too easy. And since the game's so short, well it doesnt really help if I can clear most missions on legendary on my first try.... Lastly, the last mission.... if you're going to force me into letting an AI do the heavy lifting, at least make it so that AI doesnt suck ass. I dont wanna spoil.... however god damn, if this guy's the best soldier Dare's ever seen, it's no wonder humanity lost. I woulnt call ODST weak, it's just different. And for 5€, it's completly worth the money. If i remember correctly, it was 40€ on release which is a LOT for barely 4 hours of gameplay on a regular playthrough on heroic... first try.  final edit 04/06 Halo 4 : The black sheep. The step-brother from another mother. It's not AS bad as i remembered, but it's still pretty bad. I wont dwell on it, but it just lost all the magic that made the Halo series unique. What Reach started, Halo 4 finished. It's the kind of game that makes you think ""damn, why cant they just move on instead of milking the franchise for money"". Very bad points : spartan ops. Legendary solo, it's one of the worst experience i've had on a video game. It's on par with trying to get sub 20 minutes on Regret or Gravemind. The prometheans. One, if not THE, of the worst faction i've ever had the misfortune to play against. The dialogues. Trash. Absolute trash. I'd almost go as far as telling you to simply skip the cutscenes. Good points : from a technical standpoint, it's pretty good. The soundtrack's decent too. I really, really like how the UNSC weapons sound, it has a lot more ""hmph"" and I think it's a good thing.",1576360756,1622759022,1,0,0,0.472166985273361,0,1,0,0,0,""

You will have an excellent time playing the campaigns of these games, and the multiplayer is stellar. All of the games hold up reasonably well by today's standards. As far as I'm aware, a myriad of fixes have also been made to improve the experience as time has gone by.  If you're a solo player and want to try Halo on PC, then by all means. You won't regret it.  BBBBbUUuuuT....  The multiplayer is also filled with garbage cosmetics and skins that are, in my opinion, disrespectful to the original artists and developers of the game. Some of them do not fit or were clearly made for other games. I get it, it's to encourage people to play more but it is gross. Yes, I can disable it, but that's depressing to have to do.  Additionally, personal opinions aside, Halo 2 co-op is downright unplayable. Do not even bother. Your experience will be riddled with constant crashes that force you to start again from the beginning of the mission. I really tried to overcome this, following snake oil advice from the internet, but it was too much. Don't use MCC on PC for this.  Additionally, another complaint about Halo 2 multiplayer - cutscenes are cut off slightly before they've actually ended, which took me out of it a little bit. A minor complaint but it's still there.  TL;DR: Solo? Do it. Co-op? Consider other means for Halo 2. PvP multiplayer? Enjoy crappy cosmetics.",1576360098,1688310922,1,1,0,0.52173912525177,1,1,0,0,0,""

The critical components of this game that made it so memorable have either been not included in the PC release, or have been tampered with and are worse than original. It feels like we have the body of the game but it has no soul.  Cons:  1. Forge is missing. The ability to create a custom map and game mode, which could be shared and played with friends is gone.  2. Ranking up is no longer difficult. What once felt like an accomplishment has devolved into meaningless symbols next to the player tag.  3. Armor is now unlocked by a season/battle pass system. Which is strange because there is no battle pass. The system is linear and the player can no longer control which piece of kit they are saving for. The choice between buying a helmet, chest rig, shoulder pad, etc... has been replaced with a system that forces you to unlock gear you may not even care about. It's a bland and pointless system to cater to people who wish to put in limited effort to have the best gear. Not only was the armor unlock system changed to a tasteless, confusing, and uninspiring mess... The order of which gear was rare and difficult to earn in the original game has been scrambled with minimal thought.  4. Daily and weekly challenges are missing. Earning the big credit reward for completing a week long challenge in Halo Reach was awesome. They helped push the player towards the unlock they have been fighting to earn and the game feels empty without it.  5. Players in matchmaking no longer have the ability to vote for the next map/mode. This means less popular maps are played more often than fan favorites.   Pros:   1. The game feels fantastic on my mouse and keyboard. (Feels like Halo!) 2. 343 didn't tamper with the campaign or firefight. It seems original. 3. Custom key binding is allowed and is working 4. The original armor variants, logo's, and emblems remain original for PC. Yes you can remake your old clan symbol and tag!  5. The game runs in 4K and is well optimized.  Conclusion: For a positive review 343 should have...... Simply released Halo Reach in the exact condition it was in on Xbox 360. With of course the ability to run the game in 4K as we now enjoy. For bonus points 343 could have.....  Removed the objects placed limit from Forge and add the ability to forge custom maps for Firefight.",1576357248,1576357248,0,2,0,0.545454561710358,0,1,0,0,0,""

Игра мне вроде и не особо понравилась, но и не особо хочется ставить ей негативный отзыв. Контент 18+ в игре оказался очень плохой, но зато тут присутствует довольно забавные диалоги. Помимо этого, вам будут иногда задавать очень смешные вопросы!) Так-что в плане юмора и мемов, игра получилась хорошо.   Я больше чем уверен что 98% людей, купят эту игру ради контента 18+! Но к сожалению, он оказался не настолько качественный как я думал. Возможно и есть какой-то качественный контент в DLC, но увы, у меня была просто игра. Стиль рисовки, анатомия тела, качество изображение- всё это в секс-сценах очень сильно страдает! Так-что если вы покупаете игру ради контента 18+, то на многое не рассчитывайте. Но зато в игре есть монстро-девочки, и мне такое понравилось.   Так-как это хентай игра, я решил не щекотать себе очко максимальной сложностью, и поставил лёгкий режим. Ну и как оказалось, что лёгкий режим- это реально имба. При выборе лёгкого режима, вам дают максимальный уровень, и дофига хп! Так-что выбрав лёгкий режим, проиграть фактически невозможно!   В игре нету возможности сделать скрин на F12, и это меня очень сильно опечалило! И как итог, я остался без скриншотиков=( А ещё, при запуске игры, она делает все открытые вкладки ""в окне"". Ну в игре хоть достижение есть, да и стим игру в библиотеку засчитывает. И купив эту игру, можно получить +1 игру в библиотеку, и +1 ""идеальную игру"".    Из минусов: -Маловато контента 18+ -Низкокачественный контент 18+  -Нету возможности сделать скрин на F12  -Игра сворачивает все открытые вкладки  -Нету Русского  Из плюсов: +Секс-сцены с монстро-девочками!

The story doesn't stand out too much, practically an erotic isekai with monster girls. The minor plot twist does spice things up a bit though. 2. Some enemies may be tough to identify their weaknesses before it becomes too late (Mostly in the Sementary and against Mulua) 3. There are some misspellings and wording issues.   [b]Conclusion:[/b] Siluman Fantasy serves as a solid erotic RPG with great monster girl art in both character design and sex scenes. The implementation of an in game gallery is great for viewing the sex scenes or to rebattle a specific boss. However, with it's strong adult content and gameplay, the story does not stand out too much.

[h1]Review:[/h1]  Sometimes, when a game's developers sell DLC, it's a major hint as to what the game itself will be like. For some games, it's additional locations and characters, because they want you engrossed in a narrative. For others, it's level-ups and OP equipment, because they'd rather profit from a broken difficulty curve than make the game fun for all audiences. And for [i]Siluman Fantasy -First Half-[/i], its main add-ons are artbooks and stories. So even before you begin, you can safely assume that this game has a lot of well-made art assets, and it does! ...But sadly, this is the only reason to play it. Well, that and Dark Souls memes.  There are some sexy RPGs that continue to be interesting during its narrative, combat, and/or exploration portions, but this is not one of them. The story is worse than ""Dark Souls with Sex"", because it removes interesting lore and replaces it with either ""lol this is a game"" jokes or puns about sex. It's not an Action RPG with dodge rolls and sun-praising like Dark Souls; it's turn-based combat, like most RPG Maker games, but with a gimmick of constantly spending a turn to change your equipment and take advantage of elemental weaknesses (which is itself confusing, mainly because even completely ordinary-looking gear like a pickaxe or pike might have an elemental trait that makes an enemy immune to it). And the various areas to explore are littered with instant-death ""Git Gud M8"" (that's an actual death quote) traps, such as pits or deep rivers, which can make looking for items a frustrating experience. It's nice that you can at least adjust battle difficulty from an in-game gallery at any time...but since said gallery has most (if not all) boss monster sex scenes unlocked from the get-go, what's the point in playing at all, aside from a few achievements? I guess there's the memes (in fact, at the start, you can choose to disable the sex and play just for the memes), but the Dark Souls jokes get repeated far too often to stay funny. This might be a nice game to look at, but playing it simply isn't fun.  [h1]Summary:[/h1]  Uncut NSFW: Yes, no external patches needed. Can choose to see basically all of it directly from the Gallery after the tutorial, rather than playing the game.

Очередная история про парня, который попал в другой мир, где живут монстродевушки.  👍 Симпатичные монстродевушки. Игра не требует патчей для расцензуривания, так что есть на что посмотреть. Жаль, что откровенных сцен совсем мало…  👎 Можно сохраняться только у костров, которые редко встречаются и их легко пропустить. Выглядит костёр как кучка пикселей среди других таких кучек. 👎 Элементальный урон. Некоторые сильные монстры имеют иммунитет к любому типу урона, кроме одного.

Т.е. прямо во время сражения нужно менять оружку, а это отнимает целый ход. Ужас! 👎 Смерть от падений в ямы и прочие отверстия. Ну, логично же, просто не падай.

В играх на этом движке обычно ставят блок на движение в таких местах, но разработчик, видимо, решил потроллить нас. 👎 Уровней не много, но все чрезмерно запутаны.

Secondly, the developer has asked me for an honest opinion, so that's what you'll find below.  Funds raised by this game will be used to make more games like it, and hire additional artists.   The good: - The H artist has done a good job. If you're into monster girls the game has a gallery where you can skip most of the content and get straight to the juicy bits. - This is their first game release, most RPGMaker users don't even get this far. For a small team of 2, this is a big accomplishment. - Always-run is active, so your character moves quickly. - The music isn't terrible. - Some scripts / effects were used which set it apart from the very bland default RPGMaker games, but much more could have been done. - Teleportation / fast travel through the fires.  The bad: - Most of the dialogue begs to be skipped, and has a lot of linguistic issues. This is a common issue with most H games. - Level design is large, narrow, and feels rushed and unpolished. - The sound effects feel loud by default and out of place. (default sound set from RPGMaker was likely used) - Default tilesets were used. This isn't ""bad"", but without parallaxing most of the game looks like a dime in a dozen. - A debug level was left in the gallery,  - No visible save mechanic. (game likely auto saves)  In conclusion, if you're looking for a good RPG game, this unfortunately isn't it. The beginning is there, and with time and effort a future version may be worth getting for a decent discount.  The 2D artist has focused on the H scenes and has some obvious skill, so if that's what you're looking for, you may want to check it out. If you're unsatisfied with what you paid for it, you can always get a refund after all.",1555849461,1555849461,0,77,1,0.810084939002991,0,0,1,0,0,""

Siluman Fantasy wants to be the Dark Souls of eroRPGs, but it ends up just being the Lords of the Fallen. It's an original English language RPGMaker ero-RPG, quite heavily inspired by both Dark Souls and Monster Girl Quest.  The mechanics are both the best and worst part of Siluman Fantasy - it manages to distinguish itself from the typical eroRPG by having somewhat interesting combat, especially on the higher difficulties. It's still somewhat limited by the eroRPG standard of only getting to use one character, but equipping the right weapons (which can be changed during battle) and using consumable items is required to win on the higher difficulties. Unfortunately, the mechanics are also the worst part, because it was a very buggy game that was being constantly patched all the way up to launch, and taking a single wrong step into water or a chasm will instantly kill you, costing you your hard-earned money and sending you back to the last ""lustfire"" you saved at.  The story is also unusually bad for an ero game. Most of the writing - as in, almost everything except the ero scenes - is reminiscent of an edgy early-2000s rom hack, with half of the dialogue boxes letting you shout the F word in response for no reason. Aside from that, the plot is also fairly vague and delivered in drips and drabs, much as you'd expect from something trying to channel Dark Souls.  For most people who will be interested in this, the sex scenes with the various monsters will be the draw. Almost all of them are femdom, in line with Monster Girl Quest, which was clearly one of the inspirations for Siluman Fantasy, and they're all at least passably written and decently drawn, without the random swearing and nonsense of the rest of the plot. They're fairly uncommon, though, since almost all of them are only shown when you lose to a boss, and there's only eight or so bosses in the entire game. (There's at least one sidequest with, as far as I know, the only non-femdom scene in the game as a reward.)  I don't think the gameplay is good enough to carry the game, and the plot definitely isn't. The eroscenes are likely the most enjoyable part, but be warned that even on the easiest difficulty, you still have to put some effort into completing the game. At least you can watch all the ero scenes from an in-game gallery, though? In any case, I weakly recommend Siluman Fantasy to monster girl femdom fans.",1555681951,1555694478,1,26,1,0.655006229877472,0,0,1,0,0,""
